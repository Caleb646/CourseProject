Where do we submit our team formation? Is this done through the Microsoft CMT, or is it done through some Google Doc form?#736 links to this [Google Doc ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-EagO17Og7_ESj5hkP5x4EFrVPQAtBlH9YvsgEzjnY/edit) which says: > After deciding your topics, each student should please enter their details in [this sign-up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmeAR8uMgTGbVHFwzw4UAvkFpW6ldEWO4hZt-RApO9c/edit?usp=sharing). Carefully enter the information used while registering in CMT into the first few columns (this information will be used for grading, so please be careful!). Then, enter your group name (could be anything, but please make it unique) and project theme / specific topic. Only the group leader needs to enter the project topic.

MP2.2 Deadline What is the deadline of MP2.2? In the description of MP2.2, I saw the deadline as Sept 18 at 11:59 PM CDT and was working according to that. But now I see that coursera has the deadline as Sept 18 at 1:59 AM CDT and my assignment is overdue. What is the actual deadline?It may be a timezone issue. My assignment shows Sept 18, 2022, at 11:59 pm (CDT) as the due date. Try clearing cookies and signing in with a new session. My assignment shows Sept 18, 2022, at 11:59 pm (CDT) as the due date as well. I think you may need to change the Timezone setting on Coursera.  By the way, the TA corrected the deadline several days ago. 9/18 11:59pm cst
prepare for the exam with the book Hi what chapters in the book should we read to prepare for the exam All chapter listed on the weekly overviews for weeks 1-6 on Coursera:  - Week 1: Ch. 1-6 - Week 2: Ch. 6 (section 6.3), 8 - Week 3: Ch. 9 - Week 4: Ch. 6 (section 6.4) - Week 5: Ch. 7, 10 - Week 6: Ch. 10 (section 10.4), 11 Please prioritize reviewing the **lecture videos** and your **weekly quizzes** and **practice quizzes**!   It is good that you're referring to the book, but most exam questions will be based on (and use similar notation to) lecture video material. got it thanks 
Struggling with MP2.3 I'm afraid I don't really know where to start here. Part of the issue is syntax (relatively new to Python).  The initial problem I'm having is when I try to modify "score_one()" and run the code, I seem to be getting hung up in the "if len(sys.argv) !=2" test and execution stops there. I'm sure this is something rudimentary, but any hints would be appreciated.I am also very new to python, I believe it's a boiler plate code. If you comment out these lines , you should be good to run the file  from the example """ if len(sys.argv) != 2:         print("Usage: {} config.toml".format(sys.argv[0]))         sys.exit(1) """ Are you passing the config.toml to the program?  How are you running the code - in a Jupyter/CoLab notebook, or locally? If it's local, you'll want both parameters. If it's a notebook, you can change that sys.argv check to "1" instead of "2" and just make sure the config.toml file is in the same directory as your notebook when you execute I don't know if your using an ide, i can help more if you are.  But basically you need to run the program like this...  python search_eval.py config.toml    config.toml is the argv   if you're trying to run script from terminal - python search_eval.py config.toml  Thanks a ton. That worked. hI William. what should i do if i'm using vscode? i tried print(len(sys.argv)) and i got a 1 when you said running local are you referring to the terminal?  I'm running in vscode so i guess sys.argv should be 1 instead of 2? Thank you
Question about Topic of Project Proposal  Hello,  May I know who/where can we reach out to confirm whether our project proposal is good to go? Or should we just propose something that we want to do first and wait for counterproposal?  On the other hand, it seems like the link(https://github.com/CS410Assignments/CourseProject/network/members) is not working   Thanks Hi,  You do not need approval for the proposal submission. After the deadline, the proposals will be peer-reviewed by both students and instructors.   Not sure why that link is not working - I will look into it!
Error when uploading to liveDataLab ranker = InL2Ranker()  TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/00048d28-aa90-48dd-ab39-2d2fc6fae55c/image.png)I get the same TypeError on MP2.4 too with only certain types of rankers. This only happens when uploading to LiveDataLab and I have no problems locally. Your `__init__` function needs to use default values so that it can be called *without any arguments* (i.e.: as `InL2Ranker()`). You might be tempted, like I was, to set the default to be the optimum value you found from the study. Unfortunately, this results in the grader failing. Instead you need to set default to match the skeleton code provided (see `some_param`).  **This information is not anywhere in the instructions; I found it by trial & error.**
Looking to collaborate Hi everyone, I recently joined this class so I am just getting up to date with the class structure. I live in Washington State (PST) and would love to work as a group! I am open to any time zone as well!  Please send me a DM on here or you can find me on Slack. I am excited to meet you all! Thanks, Rachel Lee You might want to join the room # project-team-search. Just found it, thank you for taking the time to respond :)
Activating VPN I downloaded the VPN client from the Illinois webstore, and I get to here: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/39055fc3-3e9e-4ec9-8f55-bdca70894110/image.png)  Am I on the right track? How exactly do I get access to the campus network?Yes, this is where you enter vpn.illinois.edu In case someone has difficulty setting up the VPN, there are detailed instructions (including an installation video) by Operating System in this [Wiki](https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=98773).
Unary encoding 0 Hi, this is more a question about curiousity, but Unary encoding is expressed as x greater than or equal to 1 = x-1 followed by a 0.  So for the value of 1, we would expect the result to simply be 0. 2, would be 10, 3 would be 110 etc...  In the case where we have a 0 value, would this result in a unary encoding NULL? Short answer: it's undefined.  Longer answer: there are two forms of unary coding: one for non-negative natural numbers (n >= 0), and the other for positive numbers (n >= 1). The second form is used in this class.  In the former, 0 => 0, 1 => 10, 2 => 110, etc In the latter, 1 => 0, 2 => 10, 3 => 110, etc  So we can represent a unary-coded 0 if we're using the first form but not the second. Notice that the same code word, ex: 110, decodes into different numbers (2 or 3) depending on which form is used so you can't mix and match and need to be consistent in which is used. Since we're using the second (ie, defined for positive integers) form in the class, 110 decodes to 3, and there is no valid encoding for 0. Thanks for your response! That definitely clarifies this.
Project Part 1 Question Just to confirm, for part 1 of the project (team formation 5% due October 17th), all we need to do is form a team and have each of us:  1) Create a Microsoft CMT account under the "CS410Expo2022" conference using our Illinois email. Where the leader has to fork the GitHub repo and create a new submission on CMT using our forked repo URL as our abstract and add group members as authors. 2) Fill out the the following google drive sign-up form (Where only the group leader needs to include the actual project topic).  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmeAR8uMgTGbVHFwzw4UAvkFpW6ldEWO4hZt-RApO9c/edit#gid=0  Am I right?i think the due date got updated, so its both due oct 23 now. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ef72084d-2cae-4a3d-8176-e45807319214/image.png) Thanks! Question solved I have the same understanding, Ali. See #736 confirming the dates and requirements: team formation on October 17, topic selection and proposal submission on October 23. I don't think this is correct. See #736  Hi, Maciej, Thanks for letting me know I had it right in my original post. Thanks for confirming!
Will Formulas Be Provided on Exam 1? Hello! Will any formulas be provided on the exam? For example, the ranking functions for Dirichlet prior and JM? Thanks!  Formulas of basic concepts are usually not provided. Please refer to the quizzes/practice quizzes about this. 
Issue about MP2.4 submission I submitted my MP this noon successfully,  but when I planned to submit it this night again. It didn't work. And it shows below: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a1c662fe-6f25-476e-a73d-7655206846bd/image.png)  I think of the token expiration issue, after I regenerate the token, and relink the GitHub account with livedatalab. But it still doesn't work. Could anyone give some hints or suggestions?Qiyang, After generating your new token in GitHub, it is necessary to go to LiveDataLab and "delete linked accounts" (top right corner of home page) then "link new account". David Thx, I will try it. I think I just relink the account but not delete the old one. I also relinked without deleting. That didn't work for me. I hope you are successful. Thx! It is fixed.
Lesson 3.3 - Slide 3 Hi, I wanted to ask if there is any particular reason some of these data points are blue and others are white? ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-08%20at%203.24.18%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b7c5e150-6108-41ba-be8a-5011492bbf2a/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-08%20at%203.24.18%20PM.png)Blue points mean the new retrieved document is relevant, so the Recall increase as the Precision changes. White points mean the new document is not relevant, so the Recall will not increase as the Precision decreases. At the end of curve, we assume that the Precision of these points is 0 because these relevant documents are not retrieved. Awesome, thank you very much!
Group Name for Solo Teams in Google Doc Hello, this may be a silly question, but I'm wondering if teams of one still need to pick a unique group name in the sign-up sheet for the project? Currently many folks, including myself, have just put "Working Alone" under the Group Name column, but I just wanted to be sure that this wouldn't cause any issues for the TAs when it came to assigning project reviewers. I'm happy to change this to a unique name if "working alone" will not work.Please try to make the name unique, if possible. This way, there will be no confusion in the grading.  Understood, thank you Kevin!
LiveDataLab Hi all, the livedatalab link should be fixed now.   To register for the course, use: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/course/join/WZS77P00E570J74   The webhook is: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger   You should be able to see your logs and score on the leaderboard.   Thanks for your patience!
build_vocabulary Hi, I am trying to understand the build_vocabulary step, do we build it from the document? is the list going to be ['willis', 'tower', 'seattle', 'chicago'...] so the lenghth would be 6?The vocabulary is the unique list of words in the entire corpus, i.e. the collection of documents. You have to process each word in each docuement of the corpus. If the word is not already in the list, then you add it to the list. The final list will look something like "['willis', 'tower', 'seattle', 'chicago'...]." thanks so the length would be 6 correct? If it helps, for me the length is 8 as '0' & '1' also got added to the list. I had a length of 8 Could you help me understand how to get from 6 to 8? I'm applying numpy unique function to the each doc in self.documents but am only getting 6 words without the 0 and 1 6 should be fine. I originally got 6, and made changes and now get 8. Is it 6 or 8, or are both fine? Me too, I wonder if a TA would bee able to answer this? Yes, 6 is correct. You may need to remove 0 and 1 as they might be the labels. I completed the project and my vocab size for text.data was 6 -> ['chicago' 'mount' 'rainier' 'seattle' 'tower' 'willis'] I passed with 8. So I guess 6 or 8 will work I had 6, as I did remove the labels. But, I suppose 8 also will not be a problem
Unequal length array while using scipy test ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%2011.45.17%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/81a75e37-2d19-4f15-a733-92a24a591bf1/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%2011.45.17%20PM.png) Hey! I am trying to calculate the p-value using the scipy.stats.ttest_rel however I am getting an error saying that we are comparing unequal arrays. The InL2 function is working for me, Could someone help me in telling where I might be going wrong ? Are you reading in the values from a text file? If so, there could be an extra newline at the end, and if it's not stripped out, you might be comparing different length arrays. I did it in R.   bm25 = read.table('bm25.avg_p.txt')$V1 inl2 = read.table('inl2.avg_p.txt')$V1 t.test(bm25, inl2, paired=T)  I think I had to change the $V1 to something like $V5 to get the actual number out of the line of text. Other than that, it worked fine. Your first list should be all float numbers, not single digits, i.e., [0.123] not [0,1,2,3]. That's why you have length of 3216 instead of 225.
p(A,B|C) This should be a fundamental math question, but it bothers me.  Does p(A,B|C) mean: 1) p((A|C),(B|C)) prob of (A given C) and (B given C) or 2) p ((A), (B|C)) prob of A and (B given C)?  Thanks!It should be the probability of (A and B ) given C this is a very interesting topic (i recommend Advanced Bayesian Modeling [ABM] course as well; it is definitely tough but will go in depth into this topic if you are really interested in this)  first, as Anonymous says notation-wise it stands for the joint probability of `A and B` given C.  generally, it is NOT the joint probability between `A` and `B Given C` $$P(A, (B|C))$$. however, if B and C are independent, than $$P(B|C) = P(B)$$, so in that way it could get simplified  i refer to this post on stackoverflow: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/440993/does-pab-cpb-pac  the C in  $$p(A,B∣C) = p(A|B,C)p(B∣C)$$ refers to your `pior information`  this is formulating, in words: the `joint probability of A and B, Given C` equals the `joint probability of A, Given B and C` times `the probability of B, Given C`  thus, your two events are `B Given C` and then, once you discover B you can discover A by `A, Given B and C `  so let's look at $$p(A∣C,B∣C)$$  i've tried deriving the equation this way, with some insight from this stack overflow answer as well https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/337667/pab-and-pac-known-what-is-pabc  $$\begin{aligned} P(A,B |C) &= \frac{P(A,B)P(C|B,A)}{p(C)} \\ &=\frac{P(A)P(B)P(C|B,A)}{P(C)} \\ &= \frac{P(A)P(B)\frac{P(C|B)P(C|A)}{P(C)}}{P(C)} \\ &= \frac{P(A)P(B)\frac{P(C)P(B|C)}{P(B)} \frac{P(C)P(A|C)}{P(A)}}{P(C)P(C)} \\ &= P(B|C)P(A|C)\end{aligned}$$  i get to the last step by cancelling out terms that are in both the numerators and the denominators. i believe this shows it is your 1) formula if my understanding is correct  it's been a little while since i took ABM so this is also review for me a bit. i am happy to try to discuss further!!  i also recommend looking into [Joint Probability Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution) to see if this helps p(A, B|C) means p(A and B|C). If A and B are independent given C, p(A, B|C) = p(A|C)p(B|C).  ',' has a higher precedence than '|' 
multiple runtime warning Hello, I got these runtime warning, after that all the likelihood value becomes `nan`. I'm not sure what is causing that.  I did normalize the matrix `topic_word_prob` and `document_topic_prob`.  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-23%20at%2008.18.12.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/818aa615-13f6-49d8-a9d5-4ab0143b99a0/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-23%20at%2008.18.12.png)Did you get it work on local ? It seems you have some overflow issue. What do you mean by "work on local"? This is the result from livelab. Did you get it converged on your local machine ?  Actually, I don't know how to run the code on a local machine. What's the command? You can run it in IDE or python xxx.py in command line. I suggest you to get it work locally before submit it to the LivedataLab. If your file is `plsa.py`, you can go to this working directory in your terminal and enter `python plsa.py` to execute your code locally. Locally, it also has these errors. It's recommended to first test **on your local machine**. Based on your logs here, it seems that you miscalculated the log likelihood.  Thank you!
Study guide for exam Will there be any study guide provided for exam preparation? I don't see one posted in coursera, though there is a lecture video (the last one) of week 6 with a good summary of topics. Could be worth checking out Each week has an Overview page with Guiding Questions. I’d recommend going through and writing answers for these for Weeks 1-6 as a study guide. They’ve been very helpful for me at least  According to the TAs/professors, the quizzes are essentially our study guides. The questions are drawn primarily from those, either exactly or similarly. From the syllabus:  > ...exams are mostly to confirm that you have indeed mastered the materials. So, they will have similar questions to the quiz questions that you have already seen. And in fact, some questions may be exactly the same as the questions in the quizzes.  I personally did not find lesson 6.10 to be of much help. It was just a high-level overview of the course material covered through week 6 with no concrete reference to the exam content as far as I could tell. In one of the office hours, professor mentioned of sharing the list of topics. I think he wanted to ensure everyone else has finished their quiz.
MP2.3 what are we supposed to do with load_ranker(cfg_file)? I'm not sure what are we supposed to do with with this function, since the instructions tell us to ignore the parameter. Am i just hard code it and a return a inl2 ranker like this?  ``` def load_ranker(cfg_file):     """     Use this function to return the Ranker object to evaluate, e.g. return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0)      The parameter to this function, cfg_file, is the path to a     configuration file used to load the index. You can ignore this for MP2.     """     #     return metapy.index.InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0) ```  that easy? really confused. why don't i just call the ranker in main if that's the caseHello, the InL2Ranker is a class you made it. That means it is not in  metapy.index. So, you can just return InL2Ranker directly. that's it? just one line?  ``` def load_ranker(cfg_file):     InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0) ```  Thank you Since it is implemented here:  ``` class InL2Ranker(metapy.index.RankingFunction):     """     Create a new ranking function in Python that can be used in MeTA.     """     def __init__(self, some_param=1.0):         self.param = some_param         # You *must* call the base class constructor here!         super(InL2Ranker, self).__init__() ```  You just need to return the class like so:  ``` def load_ranker(cfg_file):     """     Use this function to return the Ranker object to evaluate, e.g. return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0)      The parameter to this function, cfg_file, is the path to a     configuration file used to load the index. You can ignore this for MP2.     """     #     return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0) ```  For load_ranker function, yes. you need to add "return"  If don't assign param, it will use the default as in init function some_param=1.0.
Runtime warning ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/2345a52d-9ef5-47f5-89b1-b2ea79a9e995/image.png)  Could someone give advice on how to deal with this error. When testing on my local machine, these runtime errors don't come up. It's only when I run it on livedatalab does it show up.I would suggest to check: 1. If your probability matrix sum to 1 2. If your log likelihoods is a negtive value and increase monotonically. 1) Which probability matrix? There are three . Also by sum to 1 do you mean normalizing it? Cause if so, I have done that.   2) Regarding my log likelihood values, they are negative, but the first 3 to 4 values decrease(meaning go towards zero) and then from that point forwards they start increasing monotonically(in the negative direction away from zero). At around 520-570 iterations my likelihood elements start becoming (-inf) and I get the error in the photo above when the first (-inf) value shows up. After that the program runs till 4k iterations and stops showing "SUCCESS"
The MP1 "Open Tool" button is not working. Hello everyone, I am able to access the MP1 through Livedatalab directly but not through **Coursera**. However, the instructions suggest that "**It is important to access LiveDataLab from the assignment on Coursera atleast once for each MP to ensure your grades are uploaded to Coursera**."  Do we need to worry about the "Open Tool" button? Or can we ignore it since it is not working?The "Open Tool" link is broken. You can reference this previous post for the correct link: https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/11 So it means we can ignore the Coursera link and our grade will be uploaded to Coursera for sure? I just want to confirm to avoid any future issues. Thanks We are working on fixing the links and updating MP setup documentation. We will let you know via a post once it is done. Thank you!
Question 4 Hi,   I feel a little confused the result of P(Q|D2). why the value of it is 1/18. Thanks a lot.![question.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/638b08f9-cfbb-4a5c-aeec-d29b953645d2/question.png)JM Smoothing interpolates between the ML Estimate and the Collection LM  In the question above, the parameters we are given is that: ``` Query = "online course" D1 = "online course catalog" D2 = "affordable online education" ```  For D2, the only query term in the document is "online"; "course" does not appear. So, let's go one query term at a time:  $$\begin{aligned} P("online" | D2) &= (1 - \lambda) \frac{c("online",D2)}{|D2|} + \lambda P("online" | C) \\ &=(1 - 0.5) \frac{1}{3} + (0.5) \frac{1}{3} \\ &= \frac{1}{3} \\ P("course"|D2) &= (1 - \lambda) \frac{c("course", D2)}{|D2|} + \lambda P("course" | C) \\ &= (1 - 0.5) \frac{0}{3} + 0.5 \frac{1}{3} \\ &= \frac{1}{6} \\ P("online\ course" | D2) &=  P("online" | D2) P("course" | D2) \\ &= \frac{1}{3} * \frac{1}{6} \\ &= \frac{1}{18} \end{aligned}$$  The word counts per document ($$c(w, d)$$) are just the count of that term in the document and then those are normalized by number of terms in the document. In both D1 and D2 there are just three words, so when "online" appears in D2 that's how we get `1/3` for that term. "course" does not appear in D2, so we get `0/3`. The Collection LM gives us the estimates for those terms as well, which we can use for the second term in the expressions, and gives us a non-zero answer for $$P("course"|D2)$$. The final step is that, since this is a Unigram LM model, we assume each word is independently drawn from the Language Model, allowing us to multiply the probabilities together to get the probability for the whole term. One thing to note is that "education" does not appear in the query, so we do not need to use it here  Please let me know if that made sense, I am happy to clarify further Given, Q= “online course” D1 = “online course catalog” D2 = “affordable online education”  Using unigram query likelihood model, we have to determine P(Q|D2),  P(Q|D2) = P(w1|D) * P(w2|D) (since query has two words)  We know the formula for P(w|D) is:  **P(w|D) = [(1-lambda) * c(w|D)/|D|] + [lambda \* P(w|C)]**  Now, using the above formula, we will calculate P(w1|D) and P(w2|D),  P(w1|D) = [(0.5 * 1/3) + (0.5 * 1/3)] = 1/3  P(w2|D) = (0.5 * 0/3) + (0.5 * 1/3) = 0.5/3 = 1/6  => P(Q|D2) = 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/18 Thank you for your help. It make sense. Thank you for your help. It make sense.
Text book section 6.3.4 (page 104) BM25 Hello, As I was reading this part of BM25 introduction, I could not make sense how BM25 term frequency transformation be helpful in preventing "spammer"? Could someone please give me a real-world scenario where BM25 helps in this matter?  Thank you. > If we set k to a very large number, on the other hand, it’s going to look more like the linear transformation function. In this sense, this transformation is very flexible since it allows us to control the shape of the TF curve quite easily. It also has the nice property of a simple upper bound. This upper bound is useful to control the influence of a particular term. **For example, we can prevent a spammer from just increasing the count of one term to spam all queries that might match this term**If the transformation function was linear, then every count of a query term within a document would contribute to the document's rank. With the BM25 transformation function, $$y = \frac{(k + 1)x}{x+k}$$ with some reasonably-sized $$k$$, the contribution of every additional count is in a somewhat logarithmic fashion, so that an excessive occurrence of a term does not artificially inflate a document's rank (see figure below from the textbook).  For a real-life example, consider a user querying the term "computer". A spammer may set up a web page that simply contains the term "computer" hundreds of times in an attempt to artificially increase the rank of that web page on naïvely implemented search engines. Perhaps the spammer received per-impression ad revenue from the web page as a motivation for doing so. By reducing and effectively limiting the contribution of repeated uses of a term, such an attempt's success is reduced and truly relevant documents are not as easily ranked below the spam.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/466c36cf-5603-4690-93f2-771f59a97b07/image.png) It makes a lot more sense now. Your example is perfect. Thank you very much Steve
Extending Quiz 1 Deadline I was wondering if it would be possible to extend the deadline for the orientation quiz and quiz 1 for those who joined the class after the Sunday deadline.   Thank you!Same situation here. Just have the Coursera access this morning. Me three! In Coursera Platform it said will be extended to Week 8 Yes! of course! Whenever you guys submit your Quiz 1 please post a private note here on Campuswire to remind us to remove the late penalty from your grades. this is wrong, there will be a 5% late penalty per day incurred if you don't ask for an extension. Where is this information on Coursera? it will need to be corrected.
Practice Quiz 11 Q11 How is the answer that there is a tie? The closest two documents to D6 are D5 and D4, with distances of 0.1 and 0.3, respectively. They both have a label of 1. The D2-D6 distance of 0.7 is much greater than either of those.In the question, please note that these are the similarity values, the higher the similarity value, the closer the documents are to each other. If we consider this, D6 is closer to D1 and D2 for k=2 and hence, a tie of 0 or 1. The table is NOT a distance measure. It is a similarity table. Higher the similarity value between the docs, greater is their closeness.  Thus, for D6, D1 and D2 are similar. Since, they fall in different labels, the algorithm results in a tie.
Quiz deadlines issue fixed Some posts have raised the issue of the quiz deadlines being wrong. We have fixed the problem. The Week 1 quiz is due on Aug 28, 11:59 PM CDT. Please let us know by commenting on this post if you find any issues with the other deadlines or have any issues accessing the quiz.
MP3 Runtime warning Still not able to figure out why I keep getting the runtime warning: divide by zero encountered in log. I believe all my calculations are correct, so I am not sure why I am getting this error. Post #1225  Also, my score in coursera for MP3 has not updated even though my score in livedatalab is 1.  Does that mean it will be updated later or do I need to do something else?You may need to wait for a while before your grades are updated on Coursera.  I remember this happened to me when I was submitting MP2. I just added a new commit and pushed and everything worked as expected. I do not know why it fixed the issue for me. It is past the deadline now, so if it still does not show up you can contact the instructors and they'll be able to see that you submitted before the deadline.
MP2.4 Issue with leaderboard For some reason whenever I click on the leaderboard link on MP2.4 (and MP2.3 when I just tried it), I am logged out and redirected to the livedatalab login page. So, I am unable to see the scores of my submissions or any of the other leaderboard info.  This is all I can see: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9f481397-9fe6-478a-8bda-4e26be945b18/image.png)  Does anyone know where I can see the evaluation info or my score?Your submission looks good, seems like Coursera also picked it up.  But how do I see the evaluation info on the leaderboard such as my score & details of performance?  Direct link might work for you  http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/project/leaderboard/539268866
Will we get any stats for the first exam? Will we get any stats for the first exam like the class average and standard deviation?Coursera system doesn't seem to provide us with the statistics of grades, so we had to export the grades to compute the statistics. Based on the grades we see so far in the system, the mean of the exam 1 grades is 15.7 and the standard deviation is 2.76. The median is 16. This means that most of you have done very well. Congratulations!   Thanks!
For 2.3, anyone able to import numpy module? import numpy as np  livedatalab gives error,  File "search_eval.py", line 7, in <module>  import numpy as np  ImportError: No module named numpy  Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure  Finished: FAILUREIt seems numpy is not supported by livedatalab.  It's similar to scipy.  I recommend commenting out your numpy code as only your significance.txt p-value is needed after calculation. No need to import numpy. You can use math.log(x, 2).  Livedatalab does not support numpy. So, I think you have to comment out your numpy code after you got p-value.
Repo for LiveDataLab? I like the final project idea of trying to enhance LiveDataLab. Is their a code repo for that project available, or is the idea more to do a proof of concept?Currently, the repo is private. I would suggest attending Prof. Zhai's office hours to discuss this idea.
When is the deadline to review the other proposals of other groups? titleIn Week 1 Project Content, it says the deadline is Oct 30th The proposal peer-grading should be done between Oct 24 (12:00 am CST)-Oct 30 (11:59pm CST). 
MP3, Project proposal, Tech Review Topics all due the same week  I find it really stressful to have MP3, Project proposal, Tech Review Topics singup all due the same day on October 23rd, the week right after the Midterm. Even though the tech review topics signup only requires selecting a topic, but I'd still appreciate to invest time looking into all the options, reading some papers and choosing a topic I am interested in.  Given that MP3 was released two weeks later than expected on syllabus, can we get an extention on the MP3? I have the same stress as you. We have extended MP3 deadline. Hope that helps in relieving some of the stress.
Where to put idx? I'm a bit lost as to where to put  ``` import metapy idx = metapy.index.make_inverted_index('config.toml') ``` Is it supposed to be in it's own file or can I just place the ``` idx = metapy.index.make_inverted_index('config.toml') ``` after the imports at the top of the search_eval.py file?It is good practice to import libraries at the top of your code.  After import has been successful, your program should have access to the library no matter where you call it. check the example code in `search_eval.py`, which evaluates the ranker returned from `load_ranker`. the inverted index is created [on this line](https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.3/blob/c86039b9106d1a563e80be551f303eb22f2fb6f9/search_eval.py#L41)  you could restructure the code as you would like, but having it here in the main entry point also works. basically, you'll want to create your inverted index before you start calling your `ranker.score` function, as defined [on this line](https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.3/blob/c86039b9106d1a563e80be551f303eb22f2fb6f9/search_eval.py#L63), since the score function takes in the inverted index
Collaborative filtering. Is it fair to say that the length of the vector for user similarity represents the user activity? Or is the activity never taken into account for the vector representation of the User Profile? So the vector length of a user who is more active will be longer than the one who is less. Hence, if we use L2 distance for the similarity between users, then user activity will make the similarity somewhat biased?  A 2-D representation might look something like below for the vectors where the L2 distance is higher but the Cosine is less. So Cosine seems to be a better measure for similarity vs. L2.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4ee0489e-1fac-4fbb-80ed-46b619e6843a/image.png)From my understanding,  >the length of the vector for user similarity represents the user activity  I think so.  >is the activity never taken into account for the vector representation of the User Profile?  The vector incorporates both user activity history like rating of items and profiles like gender.  >if we use L2 distance for the similarity between users, then user activity will make the similarity somewhat biased?  I think so.  >Cosine seems to be a better measure for similarity vs. L2.  It depends on the features you take into vectors. If magnitude does not matter, cosine similarity works better. If it does, we prefer L2.  I understand we basically prefer cosine similarity for recommender systems because we want to categorize users with similar directions rather than similar vector norms. Yeah same here with all explanation.
MP2.1 "my submission" only shows 10 results Hi, I don't know if this happens to other students as well. For me, the page "my submission" only shows 10 of my submissions. I want to delete some duplicates (the source PDF files cannot be opened and I submitted twice by mistake) but they never showed up on the records. How can I see all of my submissions? I am using the macOS.  Thank you!You should be able to see all of your submissions (up to 50). What is your username? I'll check the records in the backend.  my username is same as my uiuc email: ypang10@illinois.edu Thanks, and can you send me a screenshot of your submissions page that you see? I found this issue yesterday. I don't have access to my mac right now but I will check it tonight. For now, I keep this post unresolved. Thank you!  Got it - if you noticed it before this post: https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/344 then the issue should be resolved. Yes, it has been fixed already! Thank you!
Additional readings Hello,  Should we be taking notes on the additional readings to prepare for the exams? Or are the additional readings to expand our personal knowledge and understanding only?  Will the exams content cover the additional readings?  Thanks!No, the additional readings will not be covered in any exam or quiz questions. You are also not required to read any of them. Of course, you will likely find those readings interesting and it would be beneficial to you if you manage to read some of them, even if it's just skimming over them.  Thank you! I have found them to be quite helpful with my understanding of the content so far, but was curious if I should be taking notes on them. That takes the pressure off while reading them though!
Exam 1 curve? Hello,  I was just wondering if there will be a curve for the exam since the difficulty seemed a bit high for exam 1. Thank you!Yes, I have the same question.  I have the same question. Yes I agree with the difficulty part! I hope they curve :( Same question here. Same question. same! Yes the curve will be really appreciated. Aside from some similar (calculation) questions, I don't think other questions are related to the lectures. Most are very tricky and require very deep understanding of the material. A curve is very appreciated.  I guess there would have no curve as the cutoff is loose. still no updates?
Submission Queue I've been on the submission queue for about 20 minutes now, was wondering if this is normal behavior?  ![](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/18017250-2869-4cda-abda-3039a323e3f4/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-30%20at%204.54.51%20PM.png)This happened to me randomly, just push again with some empty commit (like change a whitespace somewhere or something). Ideally it'll start execution with your push. That worked. Thank you!
MP3 LiveDataLab issue I am unable to get any output on MP3 in livedatalab, all my runs have the below error which doesn't seem to be with my code:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9a2d6955-5076-4e84-b020-3c1a07692f8c/image.png)  It seems like there is some error in your code. The error message is before the grade posting: 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this function   Have you tried running your code locally? Yes, my code runs fine locally without errors. If it is 100% correct is yet to be determined.  Maybe 'encoding' is not supported as a keyword by the Python version on the grader. I just updated my code and now my webhook is not working, any advice on getting that back working?  Nvm, got it working! It was the keyword 'encoding', seems the Python on the grader didn't recognize it. I made sure to use Python 3.5 locally so Idk what the issue could be.
Size of the groups for the project? Hi everyone, I was wondering what the maximum size for the group project is. That is because it says the max size is 3 in the syllabus, but it says that the max size is 5 on the Course Project Section in Coursera (week 1).  So can we assume that the max size of the group for the project is 5 people? Sorry for the confusion and thank you for pointing out the inconsistency. The max size is 5.  Is the same output expected from groups regardless of their size (e.g. group of 5 is expected to do the same amount as a group of 3)?
MP1 install metapy / multiple python versions issue Hi,  I'm not able to install metapy successfully on my Mac and I'm getting same error as some of previous posts:  *Collecting metapy   Using cached metapy-0.2.13.tar.gz (3.4 MB)   Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... done Requirement already satisfied: pytoml in ./opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (0.1.21) Building wheels for collected packages: metapy   Building wheel for metapy (setup.py) ... error   error: subprocess-exited-with-error      × python setup.py bdist_wheel did not run successfully.   │ exit code: 1   ╰─> [3 lines of output]       running bdist_wheel       running build       error: Could not find cmake executable       [end of output]*    Not too sure if this is because the instruction says we should use python 2.7 or 3.5 but my version is 3.9 (it was installed through Anaconda)? If that's the case is there any hint on how I can specify the exact python version to be used? I've already had 2.7, 3.5, 3.7 and 3.9 installed on my machine in different places (which is kind of a mess) and it is always using 3.9 by default.   Appreciate if anyone can help! You can specify the environment to use the version of Python needed (2.7 or 3.5) for the programming assignment.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqTsFOtZiQI  It works for me. I also faced the same error, I installed the 2.7.17 Python version and it helped me successfully install metapy.  Thanks this is very helpful!! I was also able to do it successfully for python 2.7 but not 3.5. Since many IDE (Visual Studio Code for example) no longer support 2.7, I created a virtual environment using python 3.5 and then select it as interpreter in the IDE. More information found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments For anyone facing the issue of installing metapy on their Mac M1/M1 Pro machines, I believe there are a couple of reasons: - Metapy does not work after python 3.7 and most of the Mac machines come with python 3.8+ installed.  - The metapy package requires "cmake" to be installed and it is not found.  The easiest way to resolve both of these issues is to install Anaconda and use it to both install cmake as well as get the right python version. Here are the steps that worked for me:  1. Download the Anaconda from their website. 2. In your terminal, enter (this will download cmake for you) ``` conda install cmake ``` 3. Next, enter the following to create an environment to use python 3.7. ``` conda create -n $PYTHON37_ENV_NAME python=3.7 anaconda conda activate python=3.7 ``` 4. Next, in your terminal, type in  ``` conda install python=3.7 ``` 5. Next activate your environment ``` conda activate python=3.7 ``` 6. You can check your python version is 3.7 here by typing "python --version" 7. Now try installing metapy again in your python 3.7 environment: ``` pip install metapy pytoml ``` metapy should successfully install now. Hope this helped!  Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43630002/conda-install-downgrade-python-version  This is one of the best summary so far, and please also refer to #28 regarding our discussion on which version of anaconda you installed (M1 vs x86) and different pathways from there.  Thanks! Was able to get python code running in the virtual environment created by conda. (Just a note that I did it even without installing cmake) I also have an M1 machine. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy doesn't work on M1. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153 Even I was unable to get metapy to install correctly on my computer. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy works natively there. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153   Thank you for finding this! However, I am still having a bit of trouble.  With regards to "conda create -n $PYTHON37_ENV_NAME python=3.7 anaconda", what does $PYTHON37_ENV_NAME mean?  The "anaconda" at the end means to install all packages present in the base environment, right?  When I try to run this command, I get a lot of stuff, then finally:  ``` Preparing transaction: ...working... done Verifying transaction: ...working... done Executing transaction: ...working... done ERROR conda.core.link:_execute(730): An error occurred while installing package 'defaults::qt-5.9.7-vc14h73c81de_0'.

What should I do? Hello,  $PYTHON37_ENV_NAME just mean any environment name you wish to use. See a complete explanation of Condo commands here: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html  hope it's helpful.  Okay. I will try to do stuff in a VirtualBox VM in the future.
MP2.4 Score  I'm just wondering for those of you who have higher scores (Top 20), are you using the Metapy ranker or your own?I used Okapi BM25 and adjusted the parameters. Note that a small change in the parameters can lead to a large change in the final score after trying both ( metapy & and my own ranker - similar to what we created in 2.3) I settled for one from metapy after extensive tuning. mainly BM25 Thank you. let's be careful here to not give an unfair advantage over people who have been making many submissions and trying many options to optimize their score. some folks have made over 100 submissions atm the top 3 alone have submitted 69, 63, and 89 times. i imagine some level of guidance is fine, but i recommend not getting too specific here until after the submission deadline Hi,  I feel idea of this exercise is for us to evaluate the different ranking algorithms and see how they work. I would suggest that we focus on learning them first and then trying them and evaluating their performance.  It would be helpful to understand the concept behind them and analyzing the type of data they would be most effective. In the process we will eventually be able to get a ranker with tuned parameters that can put one on the leaderboard. have to point out in optimization problem, sometimes pure luck is important too - there is a difference where your randomizer roll you a "0.123" to start with versus "0.124" :-)  lol ?
MP 2.4 Baseline on Leaderboard The readme on GitHub stated the following, but I don't see the "baseline" on the leaderboard.     *You must beat the "baseline" on the leaderboard to get full credit, i.e. your "Overall Score" should be greater than the Overall Score of the baseline. The last column on the Leaderboard indicates whether you completed this requirement or not (1 or 0).*  I have seen from the leaderboard, all students are 0 so far. So I think the baseline maybe an absolute score. Unless TAs update the "Overall Score" later on.  The baseline is now on the leaderboard as "test-user" with score 0.4170671141624618 (see Priyanka's comment on #583)
Working independently for final? I thought I read somewhere that working on our own is an option for the final project, but now I can't find that info. Is that correct? Thank you. Yes, that is what the "Course Project Overview" page says.  > Group work is encouraged, but not required (i.e., you can have a one-person team). The maximum size of a team is 5 members
LDA number of parameters Hi everyone,  In LDA, are there either M or K x M **beta** parameters? (where K denotes the number of topics and M denotes the vocabulary size).

I encountered the same issue  you can enter python in your cmd first, then run those line by line. You will see which line has the issue. For me, it was a line that related to metapy. So I found there is something wrong with the installation and also something wrong with the exact line I was trying to execute. Hope this helps!  Got it! Thanks so much! I will try it :)

Coursera No Score for MP2.4 Hi, I noticed that there is no score for MP2.4 on Coursera, while I got 1 on LiveDataLab. Has the score of MP2.4 been updated?

Format of questions in Exam 1 Hello, I wanted to know if the format of questions in exam 1, would be the same as all the quizzes we have had till now,ie, mcq's and select all that apply. Or would we also have questions where we have to write answers for them. Thank you in advance. Based on the comments from this announcement of Exam 1: #805   It seems that it will be around 20 MCQ's (probably a similar style to our quizzes, if I were to guess). I'd also check the last lecture of week 6 for a review. It appears the exam will be similar to the quizzes as pointed out Note this from the instructions  Exams are mostly to confirm that you have indeed mastered the materials. So, they will have similar questions to the quiz questions that you have already seen.

Log Likelihood not monotonically increasing Hi,  when working on MP3, I noticed that my log likelihood incrased from -50k to -35k after ~10 iterations, then gradually decrased to -45k at the end of the 50th iteration. Is this normal? Shouldn't the log likelihood keep increasing until it converges? Thanks!This seems unusual. Can you pass the livedatalab?  My code had the same issue. You might want to check if your E step and M step update relevant variables correctly.
LiveData lab converging after 85 iterations My code is converging after about 85 iterations on live data lab and then is saying INCORRECT IMPLENTATION, not sure how to debug further. (I am using 3 loops, could this be the reason?)  Also, the submissions are not showing up on the leaderboard.   Does this mean the mp grade will be 0 as it is not passing live data lab or will it be manually graded and given a reduced grade ? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/aae80891-cfbc-4006-9db4-1495a211908c/image.png)The log likelihood should be a negtive value. Please recheck your probability matrix. I am printing the absolute difference; my likelihood numbers are negative, Thank you!  However, I think my mistake is in the vocabulary as I have words like '\tmount' and '\tchicago' The vocab now only has 6 words, and my abs difference is lesser than epsilon at Iteration 19, but it still says incorrect  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/eb607697-0d48-4f76-ba50-f1c5bf5c2b11/image.png) comment out any print statements. Even the print statements orginally given such as "E Step:", "M steps:" ?  I removed the ones that I added and now the it goes to 85 iterations again :/ (Does this mean the mp grade will be 0 as it is not passing live data lab or will it be manually graded and given a reduced grade)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1c15be49-3545-4a4c-af0f-252c70a4179a/image.png)
Gamma encoding example The example slide about gamma encoding says that floor of log(x) is 2. My calculator is saying that ln(5) = 1.60943 which would make that floor value 1. Can anyone please help me understand what I'm missing here?Ya, you just have to use log base 2 instead of ln.
How to make sure MP1 completed successfully? I just submitted MP1. It shows submission is successful in livedatalab. The leaderboard shows the score=1 and Coursera graded 100%. As it's my first time submitting for MP, just want to make sure if it's completed? Thanks.I think it is completed. Thanks Yu Yes. You should be good.  Yeah. It is submitted successfully I think so. Once the grade is loaded on Coursera. You should have successfully submitted your work. Thanks all for the answers. I think I’m good. Enjoy the long weekend! I think the grade on Coursera will be used to calculate your final letter grade for this course. So as long as you get 100% on Coursera, you are good. Got it.  Thanks. 
Uninstalled and installed 3.7python but can't change path ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/fa67179d-7fd0-4eee-b4c7-7430a928056c/image.png) Posts say installing metapy issue need python3.7 I uninstalled the 3.10 and installed tahe 3.7 but the vs isn't using the 3.7 version, how could I change the pathIm not really sure if there exists 3.7 and when I install it again this happens ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f8fca00e-8ce8-41d1-9f81-37e5630eb545/image.png) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-so-it-finds-my-modules-packages  This is how you can update your path.  However, I highly recommend setting up a conda environment for stuff like this.  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf Could you be a bit more specific on how to use conda to solve the issue? (Im using windows and I have an anaconda navigator in my laptop https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/_downloads/843d9e0198f2a193a3484886fa28163c/conda-cheatsheet.pdf  This is another cheat sheet.    I created a conda virtual environment with python 3.5.    conda create --name MP_env conda activate MP_env conda install python=3.5  Then load the other packages like this and use this environment.  Apologies if you already are doing this!  so does this mean you aren't doing mp on vs code but on anaconda? Does it mean you launch jupyter notebook to do the mp on anaconda platform? I like Spyder personally.  I am still working on getting the right version to run spyder and the metapy toolkit.  I don't personally use vs code much, I know many people do.   I believe 3.7 was not in use anymore. If you are using Windows for Assignment, then installing the 2.7.17 Python version using Windows Installer (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) trick worked for me. Make sure you check to "Update Path" variable while doing the Install. After this step, if you run 'pip install metapy pytoml' it works smoothly. I have also tried python 3.5, been told should work but reuslt in this![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ddffe311-dcb2-4329-863b-a418c8ef6967/image.png) Do you think I should uninstall 3.5?  Also I don't see the option to update path at this step, is it normal? thanks ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/dc85fc33-d397-4186-a782-de0e5a470c86/image.png) In the above snapshot, the last cross, enable it (Add Python.exe to Path) python 3.7.13 works for me to pass MP1. Solved by using Bash Thanks Ayush, that's very helpful.
Practice Quiz #5 Q.8 I am wondering about the meaning of the following choice.  > The number of parameters in the transition matrix is smaller than the degree of freedom of the transition matrix  Is the transition matrix M for PageRank fixed or learnable? I think it is fixed from the lecture.Hello Yutaro, Please see the answer to #794  Thank you! I read this post, but I still wonder whether the transition matrix is fixed or not. In the lecture, it seems to distribute the transition possibility equally for each outbound link. Hello Yutaro, According to the lecture, the __original__ transition matrix is fixed, but PageRank algorithm iteratively performs matrix calculations to get a result.  However, I think the meaning of the quiz answer is different. To my understanding, "number of parameters" is the  number of possible web page destinations (N). Generally, "degrees of freedom" means the number of independent parameters of a model, or the number of things that can be assigned a statistical probability. This also is the number of possible destinations (N). So parameters cannot be smaller than degrees of freedom. I hope this is helpful to you. Oh, I see. It makes sense now. Thank you so much, David! 
can't join zoom meeting hey i can't join the zoom meeting - do i have to use the zoom account associated with school email address... if that's the case i can't because it shows up as "claimed". Yet according to the orientation about zoom meeting in our class, seems any free zoom account should work. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c50486e2-242e-430e-b83a-d533c250f434/image.png)Jianci, I have a personal Zoom account and had the same experience. What has worked consistently for me is to join through the browser rather than the Zoom app. This seems to avoid confusion between the Illinois Zoom account and my personal Zoom account. In any case, when I join through the browser it prompts me as required to log in to illinois.edu with SSO. After I log in, it puts me directly in the meeting. thanks! now it's showing meeting not started. I haven't be able to set up for PM1 yet - really need some help  I think Yuxiang concluded the meeting early because there were only one or two people attending. I was able to complete MP1, so I will try to help if I can. Are you running Windows or Mac? I emailed her saying I need help to get into the office hour... :-( I hope you can connect. She really tries to be helpful. also I insisted in joining the meeting via app is because the instruction specified that we needed to download zoom client app. :-/ I think we need to log into Zoom with Illinois email i did. i have taken other classes and not the first time log into a zoom office hour - somehow today doesn't work. i eventually turned off chrome completely and then went straight to log into UIUC account, then it worked. Guess like David said there was a confusion between my personal account and my UIUC account. Glad it has been resolved! I was having the same issue. After select SSO then use student account log in, I can join the zoom meeting. 
Looking for Team for Course project Hello there! I'm a master's student looking to join or create a team for the course project. I'm taking the class online, but I have a lot of flexibility to meet and discuss next steps online during the weekdays, and some weekends.   If you would like to reach out to me, you can just reply to this post or email me here at andrer2@illinois.edu. Looking forward to hearing from you all.Hey Andre, what timezone are you in? EST Same, we can team up if you'd like? Sure thing. I'll keep you posted when I get more messages. You could also try asking in the room #project-team-search .
tar command not working Hi everyone, I'm having trouble running the tar command. I'm using command prompt in Windows and keep getting a Syntax Error. There's one other post about this on Campuswire, but it didn't help me solve the problem. I've tried tar xvf, tar -xvf, and putting the filename in quotes as well as not having it in quotes. Nothing seems to work, so I'm wondering if anyone else had this issue and figured out how to solve it? Thank you!I figured out the problem I was having! I was trying to run the tar command in python, but I needed to do it in the Windows Command Prompt shell. Once I did that, all the problems were fixed. If you run the code on Jupyter Notebook, I think you can put an exclamation point at the beginning of the line of code, like "!tar ...". I solved a similar issue on Mac by adding it.
Adjacent matrix,HIT algorithm I am confused about the example of adjacent matrix given in the lecture.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/7a805472-8f35-40c2-b56e-b1b7facf9c28/image.png) Can anyone explain how the A is calculated? Thanks! It's based on the graph shown to the left: every path from a node (i) to another node (j) is represented with a 1, and if there is no path, a 0.   For example, there's a path from d1 to d3, so row 1/column 3 is a 1 in the matrix. But there's no path shown from d1 to d2, so the corresponding element in the matrix (1,2) is a 0.
Week 9 Practice Quiz To calculate the probability on question two I thought I would use the formula from the following lecture slide: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6403db4a-db33-405b-8804-daae5848cd87/image.png)  But this leads me to the wrong answer of 0.0589:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/bf50e61c-ded4-4172-82cf-e4069c7e9721/image.png)  Bit confused why the method shown on the slide doesn't apply here  This is because we are generating the document i.e "the technology" from a single model itself once it is chosen. Its given in question as highlighted above ("all"). So once we choose first unigram model, we multiply probabilities of the all the words in that model to form given document => leads us to the formula given in practice quiz. If "all" wasn't given then we would use the formula given in the slides #944 also has some further discussion here  there are two possible cases as Dhyey mentions; either the topic model is chosen before we select each word, or it is chosen before we select any word. in the first case, model selection occurs as many times as there are words. in the second case, model selection happens once. those cases will change the probability calculation

Error while setting up meta for MP2.3 Hi everyone,  I am trying to set up Meta by following the steps on this document (linked from MP2.3). When I run the make command from first screenshot, I am getting the error in the second screenshot. Please let me know if you have any ideas on how to solve this. Thank you.  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-18%20at%209.13.47%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/72d1164a-3035-4c80-978f-39c5fb75c01f/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-18%20at%209.13.47%20PM.png)![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-18%20at%209.13.21%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/39f6673f-79e5-4af5-aa25-be20d565f92c/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-18%20at%209.13.21%20PM.png) I wouldnt suggest using brew for installing cmake. Install anaconda for mac os. and using conda as package manager to install python 3.5 , then cmake and rest of the packages like metapy   check this link to create an environment with conda for python 3.5 and then activate it. then you can run conda install cmake. It should work ( it worked for me on both mac / windows) Including a post that has details of making python 3.5 environment [https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/478] Python 3.7 also works for me. You can also try it on google colab.
MP release dates Hello prof and TAs, would it be possible to update the assignment release dates in https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/wBlrv/course-deadlines-late-policies-and-academic-calendar so that we can plan better?Just FYI, we have taken note of your question and will be updating it soon.
Min of IDF(W) Just make sure that I get the correct answer since our professor leaves this one as an exercise.  The min of IDF(W) is $$log(\frac{M+1}{M})$$, right? May I ask what the base of log it use? And do we further simplify the result?My understanding is base of log is 2 log of base 2 is used !! log((M+1) / M) =  log (1 + 1/M) When M is large, 1/M is small so this mean log(1+x) when x is small, we have log(1+x) -> x. So the answer should be 1/M, am I correct?
MP2.4 parameter Can I simply change the parameter for OkapiBM25? From the leaderboard, I already got full credit, even though I only change the input parameter.Yes, if you're happy with that then you don't need to do more
What's the deadline of MP2.3? In the description of MP 2.3(pic1), it says the due is 9/25 11.59 pm, however, the actual deadline is set as 9/25 at 1.59 am ![2.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b38194a4-caf2-44fa-ae8c-ef9d1d9abd90/2.png)![1.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f3a8fe71-0966-4158-a596-ceed04c21738/1.png)(pic2). Is this a typo? As all the other deadlines are given as 11:59 PM CDT looks like a typo. Correct deadline would be Sep 25, 2022 11:59 PM. May be TAs can confirm. Yes, this is a typo, thank you for catching this!   I've updated the Coursera deadline to be 9/25 at 11:59pm CT Thanks!
MP2.2 Just to confirm again,  Search Again Your submissions  Total results: 20  **Number of submitted judgments: 5**  This should be good enough. right?Yes, looks right as the number of submitted judgements should be >=5 and the relevance has to be defined for 10 or more search results for each query.   Yes, you should be good :) I ran a search query and got 9 results back. I then submitted relevance judgement (relevant / not relevant radio buttons from the search results) against all those 9 search results. And the tool accepted my relevance submission. Just wanted to let you know, in case the search result brings fewer than 10 results, submitting less than 10 relevance judgements also will work. See here #457 
MP1 Grader Connection Error Here's the error from the submission log:  ``` raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)  requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='http', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: //livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/project/leaderboard/submit?leaderboard=63030e64205b89430b59b1f4 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7f44c47bdb50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',))  Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure  Finished: FAILURE ```  #21 Pause on LiveDataLab submissions right now until there is an update
Tech Review Approval Should we assume our Tech Review proposals have been accepted, or will there be some process for course staff to let us know if our proposal for Tech Review is acceptable or not? Thank you!It should be automatically graded via LiveDataLab oh, sorry perhaps i missed something. were we supposed to submit something to livedata lab for the tech review proposal as well? i thought we just needed to sign up on the sheet and the livedatalab was for the actual tech review report Oh no my apologies, I thought you meant the actual report. For the proposal, as long as it is somewhat related to the course, then you should be fine. So generally, there is no need to worry about the proposal being accepted! ah no worries -- thank you very much Kevin!! Is tech review for completion marks?
Doubt Regarding Lesson 2.6 In Lesson 2.6: System Implementation - Fast Search, Professor showed an example where he ranked documents based on TF sum. Can you share an example, where you rank documents using inverted indexing and scoring function as Okapi BM25?  Also in the general form of scoring function, what can be g function, adjustment function? Can you show in terms of Okapi BM25 what will be aggregate function, g function and adjustment function? In other words, write okapi BM25 ranking function in general formYou raised excellent questions! It would actually be very useful for you (and all the students in the class) to think about the answers to these questions, and I believe that if you compare the BM25 formula with the general form of the scoring function, you likely will be able to figure out the answer. This kind of practice would help you implement other scoring functions using a toolkit like MeTA (you'll have a chance to work on this in MP2.3). That said, let me also provide answers to your questions.   First, it's useful to think about the difference between BM25 and the simple TF sum scoring function. You'll realize that there are 3 differences: 1) The TF used in BM25 is some transformed form of the raw TF. 2) There's an IDF component in BM25. 3) There's also a doc length normalization component, which is actually integrated with the TF transformation. So once you realize the difference, you can think about how to modify the TF sum scoring process to support BM25. First, instead of using the raw TF, you can do some further computation on top of the raw TF to obtain a BM25 TF. That is, instead of adding the raw TF to the score accumulator, you can add some form of transformation of the raw TF.  When computing the transformed/normalized TF using the BM25, you'll need document length, which can be easily obtained from a document dictionary where we store the length for each document. Now, consider how to add IDF. This value can also be obtained from a term dictionary as soon as you see/process a query term since it doesn't depend on specific documents to be scored. You can keep the IDF of the current query term and multiple the TF value by this IDF value before you add to the score accumulator.  I'll leave the writing of BM25 using the general form of the scoring function as a useful exercise for you. 
How can we check earned Extra Credit? Hi there, I wonder whether we can check our earned extra credit or not before the deadline of dropping courses, this Friday.   Could the course staff upload the extra credit we earned so far? Thank you very much!I think extra credits get added at the end of the semester when the final credits are rolled out. There is no in between announcements. Oh, I see. Let's wait for a TA's reply. In few courses I have seen extra credit getting added during the semester.  Usually a week after the general credit is given for the assignment.   I have seen the extra credit is based on your score in campuswire. You can see there is a number by your name, and the top students get the credit The top students? Are you sure? I just saw it will be based on our reputation scores. But I am not sure of the detail. Like how to convert the reputation scores to the actual EC we get. May be TAs can help us understand how to convert the reputation scores to the actual EC we get. Our plan is to calculate all the extra credits at the end of the semester mostly based on the ranking of reputation scores and overall activities on Campuswire (but also with consideration of the nature of contributions), so I'm not sure if we can meaningfully estimate the extra credit at this point. If you have particular concerns about your grade and consider dropping the course, please post a private note to us and we'd be happy to help you analyze your current situation and provide advice to you.  I see. Thank you for your reply!
Lecture 8.9 Bayesian  Hello,  I am confusing about Bayesian estimation. What are the inputs and outputs? What are we getting from this estimation and how does it related to topic mining?![Bayesain.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b3072996-5138-40a7-b493-edfb17f6873a/Bayesain.png)In a probabilistic topic model, we would represent a topic as a word distribution $$\theta$$. We need to figure out a way to estimate this word distribution $$\theta$$. One way of estimating this is using the likelihood function (the probability of the data given the assumed word distribution). This would be the maximum likelihood estimation method, where we are trying to find parameter $$\theta$$ such that $$P(X|\theta)$$ (the probability of the data given the parameters) is maximized. The parameters here are nothing but the $$\theta$$ that we mentioned earlier, i.e., the word distribution of the topic.  Rather than just finding $$\theta$$ by maximizing the likelihood of the data $$X$$, we could incorporate any prior knowledge about $$\theta$$ that we may have (for instance, for a specific use case, $$p(w|\theta)$$ for a specific word should have a specific value). We can use Bayesian estimation if we want to incorporate this prior knowledge. Using Bayes rule, we try to maximise $$p(\theta|X)$$, which is basically maximizing $$p(X|\theta)P(\theta)$$. Note that we have incorporated prior knowledge here through $$P(\theta)$$.  This is a more general estimator than maximum likelihood estimator.   Reference: Page 341 in the textbook.

Hi Yuxiang, could you please take a look at #1241 and let me know if I'm on the right track please? TY!
Proposal Peer Rev Question Do we have to add comments for this question, or can we leave it as N/A if we have nothing to say?  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-25%20at%206.42.22%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/7156260e-bf8d-41ad-a21f-41537bc6266d/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-25%20at%206.42.22%20PM.png) I feel its more like a feedback section. If you feel everything in the proposal looks good ( and you don't have anything to add) then may be we can just mention that.  If everything looks good, then please say it looks good.  Since the class is very large, it is infeasible for the course staff to provide detailed feedback on each proposal. So we hope that you use this section to provide at least some sort of feedback to the group. 
MP2.4: Scores not updated on LiveDataLab I have been trying to run search_eval.py with various rankers and different parameters.  I do see NDCG scores get updated on my local run but LiveDatalab is not updating the score after I push changes to my private repo. Anyone seeing this issue ? Any solutions ? Thanks.Fix it  - I did not update load_ranker instead I was changing the main code :-(

Installing collected packages: metapy   Running setup.py install for metapy ... error   error: subprocess-exited-with-error    × Running setup.py install for metapy did not run successfully.   │ exit code: 1   ╰─> [3 lines of output]       running install       running build       error: Could not find cmake executable       [end of output]    note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip. error: legacy-install-failure  × Encountered error while trying to install package. ╰─> metapy ``` The `setup.py` script of `metapy` requires that you have the `cmake` binary available in your PATH (https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/setup.py#L63). You can read instructions for installing CMake here: https://cmake.org/install/.  Another alternative is to use Docker to create a container with the relevant dependencies. Personally, I prefer this approach to avoid messing with the `PATH` of my Mac unless it is completely indispensable. For example, the following `Dockerfile` creates a container with `cmake` and `metapy`.  ```dockerfile FROM --platform=linux/amd64 python:3.7-slim-buster  RUN apt-get update  RUN apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev RUN apt-get install -y cmake RUN pip install --upgrade pip RUN pip install metapy ``` Thank you! You may just install python 2.7 which would be install in /usr/local/bin/. Currently I have two python versions and it works fine for me. Tried pyenv but it is not supporting the older version of python for now.  I solved this by installing anaconda and running everything inside of it. https://www.anaconda.com/ This is the download website. After you install anaconda, go to your terminal, input "conda active base". Then, for me, I choose python 3.7 so my next command is "conda create -n py37_env python=3.7" if you want to activate the environment you just created, input "conda activate py37_env". Then "pip install metapy pytoml." If you want to exit conda environment, simply input "conda deactivate".  Wish that helps! ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8b521755-a8ca-4af4-bcbc-7178f4821f9e/image.png)  Seems like for any python version after 3.8, pip install metapy does not work :) Haoran, thank you very much for your clear instructions. I also use Anaconda and appreciate your easy solution to install metapy. So far, the 3.7 environment is working very well! It is very helpful. Thanks! For anyone facing the issue of installing metapy on their Mac M1/M1 Pro machines, I believe there are a couple of reasons: - Metapy does not work after python 3.7 and most of the Mac machines come with python 3.8+ installed.  - The metapy package requires "cmake" to be installed and it is not found.  The easiest way to resolve both of these issues is to install Anaconda and use it to both install cmake as well as get the right python version. Here are the steps that worked for me:  1. Download the Anaconda from their website. 2. In your terminal, enter (this will download cmake for you) ``` conda install cmake ``` 3. Next, enter the following to create an environment to use python 3.7. ``` conda create -n $PYTHON37_ENV_NAME python=3.7 anaconda conda activate python=3.7 ``` 4. Next, in your terminal, type in  ``` conda install python=3.7 ``` 5. Next activate your environment ``` conda activate python=3.7 ``` 6. You can check your python version is 3.7 here by typing "python --version" 7. Now try installing metapy again in your python 3.7 environment: ``` pip install metapy pytoml ``` metapy should successfully install now. Hope this helped!  Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43630002/conda-install-downgrade-python-version  Hi, I'm struggling to downgrade my python to 3.7 (i currently have 3.8.9), even though i followed your every step of your guide, until step 6, where I check my python version and it still shows python 3.8.9. Do you know how to resolve this? Thank you so much for these instructions btw! Hi Kristie,  Did the conda install process complete for you? I would also advise you to check out the discussion under my comment on #28 for the anaconda version you downloaded. If you downloaded the wrong version of anaconda, you may face this issue. Hi Gautam, I downloaded anaconda from the website per your comment, and pip install metapy works successfully, but once i try to import metapy, i keep getting the same error of "module not found". After creating the environment to use python 3.7 in your instructions above, my python version is still 3.8.9 :( Thank you! I also have an M1 machine. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy doesn't work on M1. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153 Hi Kristie, make sure you enter the python 3.7 environment before trying the python --version. Every time you open a new terminal session, you will need to do  ``` conda activate python=3.7 ``` Hi Gautam,  I got it working, thank you so much for your help!
Optional Lectures Hi, Do we know if the optional lectures for Week 5 & 6 are included in the exam? ThanksThey are not, no None of the optional lectures would be covered in the exam.  
Peer Review - Submit or Save Draft? I am not clear on whether to submit or save as draft the Proposal reviews?  We can obviously only score the proposal, but will submitting maintain the page visibility for future scoring of progress and final?Please submit the proposal, do not just save as draft (in the latter, it will not be visible to the authors). And yes, submitting will maintain the page for future scoring of progress and final reports. Thanks!  When I try to submit with only the answers for the proposal related questions, it doesnt let me to as it highlights other questions in red and asks me to fill in the values. What can I do?
Tech Review Sign-on Sheet Just curious, in the sign-on sheet, why do we need to provide github link? also, there is one column for reference - does it imply we only need to read one paper (because it's a short review for only 2 pages). Or doesn't it mean that we need put list all the reference in a single cell?? I think in the reference column you can mention links where one can find more information about the topic you chose for tech review. For example, if the topic you chose is "NLTK for information extraction" then you can put the following link in the reference column "https://www.nltk.org/" To add on to the current answer - we ask that you provide a Github link so that other students can view and learn from your technology review To my understanding, the review should be a pdf file uploaded to our GitHub. Is that correct?  Yes - and make sure you follow the pdf naming conventions. LiveDataLab will not register a grade if the file is incorrectly named.  thanks for all the answers - got it
Exam and ProctorU Public Service Announcement - the next available Proctor U appointment is 20 hours away! I have always previously found that if you pay the premium, you can get a spot in minutes. Not today! So if you haven't booked yet, get on it asap. Maybe they should introduce Uber surge charging... :-)Next available spots around midnight CT, and then pretty consistently from then on. I suspect there was a holiday.  In general, it seems to show results up to 85 minutes after the time you specify (ie, selecting 5:35 would show you 7:00 but not 7:10) and up to 30 minutes before the time you specify (ie, selecting 5:30 would show you 5:00 but not 4:50).  But! It's also weird! Searching for 6:00 AM showed me 6:30AM, 6:40AM, etc, but searching for 5:00 AM showed me spots for 6:00 AM, 6:10 AM and 6:20 AM. I think their Ranking function needs some work!
Unable to install metapy after activating conda environment I'm trying to create another conda virtual environment with python 3.5 on it since python 3.7 is having issues. I have done the steps described in other posts such as #28. When I do, I cannot install metapy.  I keep getting "legacy install failure" every time I do so. I have been trying to remove the virtual environment when it doesn't work and do the whole process over again, but I get the same error.  When I installed python 3.7 for MP 1, it worked perfectly, but when I try to install a lower version, I have issues and I'm not sure how to fix them.is there a reason you are trying to use a lower version of python? for me version 3.7.14 worked fine for both MP1 and MP2.3 metapy should work with python 3.7. What issues are you facing? Anisha, I confirm that metapy can be installed and works properly in a Python 3.7 virtual environment. Please share more information about the problems you are currently experiencing with 3.7 and maybe someone here can offer a more specific recommendation. David  I mainly asked this question because I've seen posts where people have had issues running the ranker function with 3.7, but it ended up being fine for me.
Calculating Log Likelihood the calculate_likelihood function in the MP asks us to calculate the log likelihood of the model using the updated probs. Is there an equation on how to do this? I tried looking in the 9.7 and 9.8 lecture slides but did not find steps for calculating the log likelihood using the probability matrices.   Can someone guide me on the process I need to follow for this? Thank you so much!  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-11%20at%2011.22.05%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3408c951-43f8-41e4-81c0-17fbeae43fd7/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-11%20at%2011.22.05%20PM.png)The formula is written here: ![log_plsa.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/cfbcd9fb-1d1a-419a-81ac-cb3e07e73c64/log_plsa.png) Without giving away the exact code, you can think of your self.term_doc_matrix as *c(w,d)* , self.document_topic_prob as *$$\pi$$* and self.topic_word_prob as *p(w| $$\theta$$)* . Hope this helps! Do we have to check if c(w, d) does not equal zero, for each combination of word and document?
Clarification on Summation part of the formula for Ranker I believe I have implemented everything in the formula except for the summation. When I interpret the summation part of the formula, I think it is "for each term in the query and the document".  However, the specification for score_one states that "You need to override this function to return a score for a single term." Wouldn't this reasoning make the summation part of this formula irrelevant or is there something in the way I am interpreting this part of the formula that is the problem?No, you don't need to implement the summation You don't need to implement the summation, python code will take care of it. in the assignment, it says "The function you’re writing represents one term in the large InL2 sum."
groups size + work distribution how was wondering how does the work load compare to a group of 5 compared to a group of 3? There is a post, I think, that said we should do N * 20 hours of work, with N being number of people in your group. I suppose the work load of each person should be 20 hours

practice quiz 3 - Q6 For this question, can someone help me how to derive the parameter should be higher? I get the point that recall should weigh more. What is the equation of F measure?![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-09%20at%2010.38.47%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/868f8714-07c2-4d6d-8ac8-66de2a3dd090/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-09%20at%2010.38.47%20PM.png)I also wondered about this one. Luckily, this has been discussed a bit in #389  ; to summarize: in the F-measure, Recall is considered $$\beta$$ times as important as Precision in the F-measure. This means a higher $$\beta$$ will balance recall as more important, which for this case would likely be more valuable since we would want to ideally retrieve every possible document related to terrorists communicating about attack plans on US soil, even at the cost of getting some irrelevant documents back (also confirmed in the descriptive text you shared saying "low precision is less harmful")  Post #386 is also mentioned in that discussion which provides further clarity on F-measures  Please let me know if that helped or if I can provide any clarification! which week? To answer this question, we need to figure out two things: - What does the tweet search for possible communication between terrorists represent in terms of the user task, i.e., do we want to get only the top results or as many results as we can? In this case, it would show as many tweets as possible, so we have to reward **recall**. A higher recall value means returning most of the relevant documents. -  How do we adjust the `F-measure` to reward recall? From the formula $$F_{\beta} = \frac{(\beta^2+1)P*R}{\beta^2P+R}$$ we can appreciate that the **Recall** weight is $$\beta$$ times **Precision**. Therefore, when $$\beta = 1$$ Precision and Recall are given the same weight, and when $$\beta > 1$$ **Recall** is given more importance. There is a **great post** from the professor about this topic here: https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/237. Also, check David Burrus' answer. week3
MP2.4: The purpose of the task Hi,  MP2.4 seems to be just about fine tuning the parameters for the ranker method that we choose. We aim to beat the baseline, which we have no idea about how it was generated and therefore it becomes a number-guessing game.   For me, the concept of beating the baseline sounds fun. But this is just performing some grid search and then brutally testing with an interval. The method related to parameters fine tuning is also not covered in the lectures.  I am just doubting what we are supposed to learn from this exercise?  I wonder if I understand the task correctly? I've completed MP2.4. Your description is accurate-- just parameter fine tuning. I think ostensibly you're supposed to learn how parameters influence different rankers.  Thank you for your reply. Yeah, it does feel a bit strange. The connection does feel very weak. From some other UIUC courses, you will be directed to experiment and will, for instance, generate some graphs which will illustrate this point, or even compare different methods clearly. But for MP2.4, it is just like randomly guessing and comparing.  Maybe it is also part of the daily work for data engineers? Haha. I think there is opportunity with it. And the class competition part is fun.  I've been trying to understand why one ranking method performs differently, whether there is an interaction between the parameters or if they're independent, and just using it as a way to better understand the content.  Yea I agree with Joseph. I believe it's just to really help our own knowledge and understanding to why certain parameters work better than others. If we see a performance change using different parameters, i believe the exercise wants us to think why exactly did that change and use better parameters based on that. Don't think you are supposed to just randomly guess numbers and brute force it,  but rather try to make better and better educated guesses based on what parameters and results you have seen so far.  By "random guessing", I mean under the current structure of the MP, making an educated guess is not very likely.  Take BM25 method as an example, we learnt $$k1$$, $$b$$ from the lectures and understand what they mean. But fine-tuning these parameters has a lot to do with the target queries and documents. We received one sample dataset, but have no ideas about the other two. There is not enough information presented in the task description.   Also I was expecting there should be more information about how the TAs got the baseline. I like the form of this fun competition. But without knowing how the baseline was generated, comparing our results with the baseline becomes less meaningful. Yes, we beat the baseline and got a better search engine, but why? Which part did we do better than the baseline, and which part not? We have no way to find out. Ah I see what you are saying now. Yea that makes sense I would also like to know how to properly find out the best parameters as well. Hopefully we can get some kind of guidance or clarification on that.
Project topic for Oct 17th deadline Do we need to have the project topic and brief description filled out in the google sheet for Team Formation which is due Oct 17th, or is the topic and brief description part due along with the proposal due date of Oct 23?  I am asking because I think it may take some time to come up with an idea for the project.It isn't strictly necessary, but please try to write down a rough idea. You can always change it between now and the proposal deadline. 
Values of c in InL2 ranking function. I have implemented the InL2 ranking function. What is a good range of c values to test for it?You can start with a wide grid search and then narrow it down from there. To start off, I usually like to begin with a small steps and then grow exponentially larger, e.g. $$c > 0 \rightarrow$$ c = [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000]. After your first run, determine which of those values seem to have the most desirable values, and test a smaller subset around them and repeat until you determine any further gains to be negligible. I did  a grid search as Steve recommended. sorry, I am confused. Do you mean the c should not be 1 as the default? Should the code have the optimal c just for the first part of "Writing InL2" . Thanks! We were supposed to investigate various c values and check which was the best, though this part was not graded.
Reviewing Past Quizzes Would there be a way to review the actual quizzes (or is the practice quiz the only means of reviewing for the exam)? The 'try again' button is greyed out, so I cannot retake the quizzes without seeing the answers inside of 'feedback'.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/08a36f65-4208-4bb6-976d-ab884fa8fb45/image.png)There should be a `View Feedback` button when you go to the quiz assignment. While you cannot take the quiz again, you can see what you answered and what was correct or not  Let me know if that helps; i can also upload a screenshot showing the button if that helps I agree. It would be nice if it can be enabled now. It will help to practice for the exam.    I agree that it will be of great help, but not sure if it would allow.

Clarification for MP2.1 Hello,  I just want to make sure I am understanding correctly.   For MP2.1, I have set up the VPN, chrome extension and successfully submitted one page so far to the digital library.   To complete MP2.1, do we simply submit 15 unique webpages/resources?   Before starting this MP, I followed the MP set up instructions before I realized the coursera page had different instructions and was brought to this github page: https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.1.   Is this github page still relevant? or should we be focusing only on the 15 unique resource submissions as I was seeing we do not use livedatalab?  Thanks!> To complete MP2.1, do we simply submit 15 unique webpages/resources?  Yes, this is all that is required for MP2.1.  > Is this github page still relevant? or should we be focusing only on the 15 unique resource submissions as I was seeing we do not use livedatalab?  Sorry for the confusion, the github page is not relevant to MP2.1 nor MP2.2. You should only focus on the 15 unique resource submissions, and you do not need use LiveDataLab.   Thank you Kevin! I will try to find some insightful articles to add No problem, and wonderful! Looking forward to reading what you collect.

Week video 9.5 question ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/605b16a9-bd4b-49c7-8d4c-0bff8c1fbc43/image.png)  Can anyone explain c(w,d) and Z=0| w',  what does the w' stand for here?Since $$p(w|\theta_{d})$$ is a probability, we need to normalize the numerator $$c(w,d)p^{n}(z=0|w)$$ by dividing with sum of $$c(w,d)p^{n}(z=0|w)$$ for all the words in the vocabulary. So in the denominator, we are summing over all words $$w^{'}$$ in the vocabulary. c(w, d) stands for the count of the given word (w)  in a given document (d), Z stands for the topic, and w also means the given word.

MP1 - No module named metapy Hi , I followed few posts and installed anaconda and in the base did set up python 3.7 environment. Then opened the visual code and tried to run the bare code and still see the error "No module named metapy". Am i missing any link or step here ? Please suggest !   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ec1ed007-672e-4dc3-9ad3-cd9cd6c19521/image.png)I think vscode is not recognizing the conda environment. It's is active within the Anaconda prompt but is not active in vscode.  There are a couple of things you could try: 1. You could try running the script, ```example.py``` within the Anaconda prompt. 2. You could activate the environment in vscode by pressing ````Ctrl+Shift+P```` to open the command palette and press *Select Interpreter*. You should see your environment in the drop down and then select it to activate it. Thanks for another pointer there. This would probably also have solved the problem. I was able to fix it by uninstalling python and installing another lower version and it did the trick.  You could just pointed to version 3.5 using Conda for setup.  Please refer to the is post:  https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/200  This was posted by a student Charles Stolz and helped me with installing metapy without having to uninstall Python version 3.7.  conda create -n cs410project1 python=3.5 conda activate cs410project1  pip install metapy pytoml There’s usually a shortcut via a status bar in the bottom right of the window, as well. I recommend using the Google Colab. With Colab, you don't have to worry about the environment setting. Create a new notebook with Colab and install metapy using the following command, and it's done! ``` !pip install metapy ```  Hope this helps.
MP 2.3 Issue I did some trouble-shooting with my code, and cannot figure out what the actual issue is with my ranker function. For context, I am using math.log(w/e, 2), and I checked to see if I had copied any of the external files incorrectly from the TA's MP2.3. Also, I managed to get the points for the significance-test aspect.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/17f94c38-d5c3-436f-a6b4-a19b1651c780/image.png)  The issue that the auto-grader gave me was quite vague. Anyone got advice on how to circumvent this issue?Hey Justin -   I'm curious, what do the "w" and "e" represent in math.log(w/e, 2)?    It's obviously difficult to suggest potential revisions without more information, but without giving too much away I think I can safely mention I got an average precision of 0.5 for Query 2 (when using "some_param" = 1.0).  If you got something different, I suspect it's simply a matter of going term by term and making sure your formula:  1. precisely matches the equation provided 2. references the correct fields from (https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html)  3. has the correct order of operations (i.e. parentheses are where they belong)  Apologies for the obvious suggestions, but I feel but that's all I can safely say without saying too much.  I verified the parenthesis, and I'm also getting 0.5 for Query 2.  How does the grader verify that the implementation is correct? Am I supposed to save the output to a file or print to the console?  For the log, I meant I used math.log(val, 2) instead of math.log2(val) because grader is using Python 2.7. the grader only verifies that the inln2 function has been implemented correctly for the first part.   check that you have implemented the two equations correctly, and that you called InL2Ranker (score_one) in load_ranker Ah maybe that's the issue...I didn't make any changes to the code that prints to console.   I believe the two text files with the average precision outputs are simply used to perform/verify the hypothesis test, but the first part probably expects the results to be printed to console. 
MP 3 Grade not updated on Coursera Hello,  I submitted MP 3 and received 1 on the leaderboard in livedatala. However, my grade on Coursera is still not updated. Please help me! Am I doing something wrong?  Thank you, Heet ParikhThis post covers an similar issue for MP1: https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/155  See if that fixes the grading issue. Got it, thanks!
Office hour recording Do we have recordings for OH?Yes, you can find it here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/resources/nOxcB
MP1 - github intro? Hello - for those of us without experience using github, are there any introductory resources you would recommend?  Thanks!There are several resources that will walk you through the basics of forking, committing, pushing to remotes, and branching that will enable you to complete the assignments. Here are couple of good places to start:  https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources https://skills.github.com/  If you would like to further understand Git I would recommend the book Pro Git. It's freely available here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2. Thanks a bunch Rick! I was able to fumble through enough to submit the assignment but I also know this is an important tool that I want to be more comfortable with. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git  github has some resources that can help you ramp up!
Backend Server Hi there, thank you all course staff for your hard work on the course project. I see the next deadline is for project progress report. May I ask when we can get the credits for renting the server on AWS or GCP. Or some instructions about using online server on campus?  Our proposal involves two main components. One is the Chrome extension, and another one is the backend server for storing research papers (a database of a collection of documents) and real-time responses (send the pre-computed ranking and get information from other online websites like Wikipedia to users).If you sign up for the Github Student Pack with your UIUC student id card, you get a $100 credit for Azure Cloud, $200 credit for Digital Ocean, and $13 / month credit for Heroku.  https://education.github.com/pack A quick cheat is to use a CSV file as your database (I know, cringe) , and from there using Github's website hosting ability. Anyone who has a Github account has a free website using Github Pages.   Here is a link that will explain more: https://pages.github.com/  You will have to have some web development knowledge, but it is certainly possible to do so free.  I don't think that we can provide credits for renting a server. But for the purposes of the course project, you can demo your project locally, or as others suggested, use free methods / student sign-up benefits. If we can demo locally,  we do not need to consider an online server then. Thank you for your reply!
Textbook I have a quick question. Will a free download of the textbook be provided? Thanks!Yes, you can search the library website https://www.library.illinois.edu/ for the text book, there will be pdf download option on it. The textbook name is mentioned in the syllabus I believe.  sad. I haven't got my I card approved.  Attached for everyone's convenience: [TextMiningAnalysis-zhai.pdf](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/53cfe92e-18dc-482d-80d7-866b6396e612/TextMiningAnalysis-zhai.pdf) Thanks a lot!
Exam 1 Slots on Next Friday Hi, this is my first time using ProctorU.  My ideal schedule for exam 1 is on next Friday, October 14, but currently there is no available slots on next Friday. Does anyone know whether more slots will be released in the future? Or is the current available schedule all we have?  Thanks in advance!I found that keep on hitting "next available times" will show more slots than just hit submit on the select time section. I think there are no more slots for Friday or Saturday. Those who waited for "additional instructions" from the TAs were pretty late in the game. Kinda messed up. It would be nice to have some more slots open those days. I booked a slot several weeks ago and there were no Friday or Saturday exam slots open then, either Seems to be a big issue with ProctorU availability - or it could be planned site maintenance or something. Either way, I'd assume there wouldn't be additional slots released...that's a ProctorU issue, probably not something CS 410 staff can provide.
Fail to download file by wget I tried to download file through wget in the readme file, but the following error occurs:  Invoke-WebRequest : A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'nc'.

Thank you.It looks like you are using windows prompt. I found this link may help you   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70687650/invoke-webrequest-a-parameter-cannot-be-found-that-matches-parameter-name-lfo I got the same error and this was my roundabout way of getting it to work: ``` pip install wget import wget url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt" filename = wget.download(url)  tok = metapy.analyzers.ListFilter(tok, filename, metapy.analyzers.ListFilter.Type.Reject) ```  Here's more information about the wget python package if you're interested: https://pypi.org/project/wget/ For windows, the below worked for me from the command prompt curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meta-toolkit/meta/master/data/lemur-stopwords.txt  > lemur-stopwords.txt You can always go to the website and download the file. Hi Sophia, thanks for this trick. It was really helpful. Did this also work for you when you had to run the tar command later on? I can't seem to have that work Please disregard. I figured out that the problem was that I wasn't running the command in the Command Prompt shell, but rather in python. Thanks! Hi Arda, I'm glad that was helpful. The tar command just unzips and extracts the files downloaded from wget, so I did that manually using free software like 7-Zip.
MP2.4 Overall Score of the baseline  Hello,  Could we find the"Overall Score of the baseline" from letterhead? Also I am wondering how is the baseline score calculated (so that we understand how to beat it).  Thanks.where can we find baseline score?
Submitting MP1 (Github Account Not Found) Hi,  I need some assistance in configuring GitHub with LiveDataLab.  All my code is done but I am having trouble during submission. I have tried re-linking my account in GitHub multiple times as well as re-provisioning my PAT and recreating the webhook (as suggested in other threads).  None of these have resolved the communication between git and livedatalab.   Can anyone assist?  Linked account: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/7af10296-e4ff-48a3-97b6-ab0ce680f6e2/image.png)  URL: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger Webhook Settings: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3944dde8-daca-480e-9be3-ad89f7465c4d/image.png) Webhook Delivery Log: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1648daf4-f99b-48d0-be9a-a36ff39339fc/image.png)For your linked github account, the host domain should be github.com (note the lowercase 'g') not Github.com. Please delete the linked account, and then try again.  Thanks Priyanka! I can see the webhook working with LiveDataLab now.
Are the Quizzes Open Note? My guess is that the exams are closed note based off the fact that we are using proctoring software but what about the quizzes?Yes, the exams are closed note, but you can use whatever resources for the quizzes. So if you are uncertain about a quiz question, you could (and should) go back to the relevant parts of the lectures to (further) study it until you fully understand it, and then you can go back to the quiz question to solve it. However, the best practice is to FIRST make sure that you fully understand the lectures BEFORE attempting to work on the quizzes. This way, you can use the quizzes as a "mini exam" to check how well you've mastered the week's materials. That is, try to be fully prepared before you start working on the quizzes. This has the extra benefit that you will be very confident when it comes to those two exams  as the purpose of those exams is mainly to verify that you can indeed independently and confidently solve the questions in all those quizzes. Some exam questions may be identical to the questions you see in the quizzes. The WORST practice is to do the opposite, i.e., start with quiz questions and try to guess the correct answers and only review the lectures about questions that you didn't answer correctly. This would leave many holes in your knowledge and you'll still have to re-learn all the materials in order to do well in the exam and you probably would not be confident in being able to answer all those questions in the quizzes even when you can score well on the quizzes. So please do not do that! Always make sure that you watch all the lecture videos before working on the quizzes. You'll benefit most in this way. It's also the most efficient way of learning and would ensure that you don't leave any hole in the mastery of materials from the previous weeks.  
tech review content Hi,  I saw there is a discussion about the content for Tech Review #1052   So, based on my understanding, if we choose a topic/paper (e.g., an arXiv paper as the reference), we essentially condense it to ~2 pages using our own words?  Thanks!It is a bit broader than that - if you select a topic, you may find 3-4 reference papers on that topic, and summarize the high-level points and take-aways in your tech review.  Many thanks!
Group Work Required? I just want to double check; the syllabus states that for the final project, we must work in groups of `at most 3`. would a group of 1 (aka, just myself) be acceptable as well, or do we need at least one partner?You can work independently (and sorry, the syllabus is out of date: the max size is 5). However, we do encourage students to work in groups! How can I find teammates? I have same question , also if I will not be able to find teammats due to time zone etc…
Practice 2.3: binary representation? Hi, for this question, it's easy to get the gamma code for 9 is 0001001... but I'm super confused about the rest of the question- what is the binary representation of the gamma code? Isn't the gamma code already in binary form??? are you asking about the binary form of "1001"?Hi, the gamma code 9 is not 0001001, the question asks exactly for that, at ~10min in the lecture 2.5 video, there is an explanation ha thanks- got where i was wrong. 
What is the valid range for log_likelihood values? Hello,  To everyone that completed MP3, could you please give a general idea of what a good log_likelihood value is like after some iterations? I am trying to find out why my submission is not getting accepted, but I have no clue if I am moving in the right direction or not. A pass/fail result is not really helpful in this regard. Thank you in advance.It should be negative and decreasing. I saw some people reporting large negative values after multiple iterations. Convergence means that the absolute difference should be decreasing. You could run multiple times to check as the optimization might be influenced by the initialization.  I just finished MP3 and completed it and my code never hit the the absolute difference stop condition, but this is what some of my likelihoods looked like ``` [-inf, -257249.44227615878, ...   -227154.83981627066, -227154.83297881295] ``` This was for 100 iterations of the test.txt data, but 50 iterations of it had similar numbers in the -20k range My values are quite similar (-17xxxx) and it converged, but didnt get accepted by the grader.  Not going to lie, I was lazy at the very end and just decided to do this function using 3 nested for loops (one pertaining to each $$\sum$$ in the formula) and that worked for me, so could work for you. Other than that perhaps your formula interpretation is wrong not sure though. So the for loops are allowed? Interesting, I might go for that if I cant figure this out. Thanks for the insight I'm also getting values in the range of -177xxx. Does anyone know what could be the reason for this? in `main()` function, number of iterations is 100, but it's not large enough for my algorithm to converge. My case converges at roughly 450 iterations on test data. Hi! So do I! Did you figure out what issue it is?
MP2.3 cant parse config.toml Anyone know what to do about this error in google colab? I couldnt find any info online and I used the copy path option for the path to config.toml. I tried using both python 3.6 and 3.7 btw.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3d433124-83cc-4914-b262-3b83e1dae7bc/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c3f54acf-1a0c-409d-b1d5-e61c2c771f1e/image.png)How are you running this program. Did not run into this issue.  You can try this, in the folder where the files are present (on terminal cd to that folder) python ./search_eval.py ./config.toml  this should work  I am using google colab, so I am trying to run that individual line. Looks like a relative vs. absolute path error - in what environment are you running this? If it's on a local machine, you almost certainly don't want "/" which tells the function to look at your root directory...  The provided function looks like this: >     cfg = sys.argv[1] >     print('Building or loading index...') >     idx = metapy.index.make_inverted_index(cfg)  ...and when you run the program (`python search_eval.py config.toml`) it looks for `config.toml` in your current working directory.  Try replacing "/" with "./" and see if that fixes your issue  Saw your comment about using Colab - in that case, make sure config.toml is in the same directory as your notebook, and definitely use "./" instead of "/" before `config.toml` I believe its in the same directory. This is my files directory. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/346b4c42-9efc-4811-a821-353b2cf8add0/image.png)  Replacing "/" with "./" still gave me the same error If it is in the same directory on google colab, just remove the "/" and that should do it. Has this problem been resolved? Have not found a solution. invalid file for list filter should mean that the path to /config.toml is correct but the things inside it are not. I am having the same issue, is it resolved for you? It was not but I just modified the score_one code without testing and it worked It has not been resolved, Im still unable to run the code in colab
Setup instructions for MP2.4 wrong on Coursera - webhook Quick note in case anyone else is in a similar position where their webhook isn't working for MP2.4:  The PDF setup instructions linked on Coursera for MP2.4 list an incorrect webhook URL in step 13. The correct link is listed in the first setup instructions (from MP2.1) - http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger  Seems to be a few different versions of the MP setup instructions floating around and several have the wrong LiveDataLink webhook URL...hoping this can be corrected for future MPs!
MP3 - build_term_doc_matrix() issue  Hi, can anybody provide any hint on how to build_term_doc_matrix()?  I use collections.Counter() to get a list of dicts, which is {key : count} for each document. Since some keys are missing from some documents, I wonder how can I turn this into the matrix we need? Thank you. your `term_doc_matrix` is a matrix with M columns and N rows, with M being the vocabulary size and N being the number of documents.  considering the "brute force" method where your just have a nested for loop, you can then do the following procedure (pseudocode):  ```python for d in documents:   for j in vocabulary:     # count of term j in doc d     term_doc_matrix[d][j] = count(j, d) ```  i did not use counter, and it seems from previous posts it may not be the "recommended" method (though it seems others have used it successfully). you should be able to perform some sort of expansion on your dictionary, but you'll have to be careful because in python dictionaries are ordered by insert order.  for me, it was much simpler to go with the more straightforward approach It's better not to import extra packages as livedatalab may not support them. You can simply use a for loop in this function.

MP2.3 Instructions I am a bit confused about what we're supposed to do in MP2.3.  The avg_p file of a ranker for the p-value calculation - will it contain the MAP of the ranker with different param values? Or will it contain per query avg_p values for a particular param of the ranker?  Say for BM25, shall we fix a k3 and print the avg_p of each query in the avg_p file? or shall we vary k3 10 times and print the MAP of these 10 settings in the avg_p file?  If we calculate the p-value using per query avg_p values at a fixed k3 of BM25 and a fixed c of INL2, where do we use the analysis with varying ranker params to find maximum MAP?Your output of new rank function and BM25 will be like this : query 1 avg_p= query 2 avg_p=  ... ... query 225 avg_p= There is nothing you need to change for the BM25.  All you need to do is to append the average precision of each query of new rank function and BM25 into list(or array), then use the code below to calculate the p value. Finally put the p-value into significance.txt   from scipy import stats   stats.ttest_rel(rvs1, rvs2)  *rvs1, rvs2 are two lists for p-value calculation in t-testing.  see the reference: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html   Hi, thanks for getting back. I actually did exactly that. But I am confused about where are we supposed to put the analysis of the varying parameter. For example, we're instructed to check how varying c affects INL2 performance. So, we're supposed to run INL2 with 10 values of c. But in which function are we supposed to loop over the 10 c values? Once you are done with the 70% test in the program you can create a file that holds the floats in a file. Then create a similar file using BM25 algo and compare them with the Scipy function. The final file only needs to have the p-value, a float value, for the grader to work. Make sure you check the output of the scipy package and see that the p-value going into the file. You do not need to submit the test code just the significance.txt file containing the p-value In the main you can loop with 10 different c to  test.  Thanks.
How to run search_eval.py? Hello,  I think I'm lost in doing MP2.3.  When I try to run search_eval.py, there is an error like following: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/99b3b8d4-330f-4d6f-9faa-1c1491e9c080/image.png)  It seems that there should be two sys.argv for running the python file, but I couldn't find guides about arguments for search_eval.py.  Could you tell me a little how I can run search_eval.py?  Thanks.Run it by doing: python search_eval.py config.toml

Anyone have a grade on MP 2.2 yet? We were targeting to release it on Sep 21. Yeah I also don't see a grade for MP2.2 - Assuming TAs will publish grades later this week since many of us don't have grades out yet.
MP3 deadline Given the amount of recent confusion on MP3, I believe it is safe to say this final MP has proven difficult to a majority of the class. Given the already generous extension of 3 more days, would it be possible to extend the deadline to Friday?   I feel as though many students are overwhelmed and have likely accepted the fact they will be turning this in late.    Thank you for your considerationHi, we won't consider to further extend MP3 as it seems unfair to the students who have finished it, but we have reduced the late penalty to 20%.  I believe this to be a fair middle-ground and appreciate your consideration. Thank you very much.  Is this late penalty per-day?
MP 2.1 Grade Hello,  I submitted my work for MP 2.1 before the deadline (15 entries), but Coursera shows it is overdue.   I understand that grades for this MP will be entered later in the week, but just wanted to make sure that the "Overdue" that is shown on Coursera won't affect my grade.  ThanksI was about to ask the same question. Thank you. I think the assignment will be shown as overdue until the TA team updates our score on Coursera. The overdue is recorded by Coursera because it didn't detect a submission by the deadline. This was the case for some of my other courses too. Please see https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/430 As already suggested in some posts below, please don't worry about the "overdue" status of MP2.1 on Coursera. It will be graded using the CS410 DL system and we'll upload your grades to Coursera later.  2.1 Grade is already released. Its showing a grade for me. Can you please try refreshing Coursera and accessing the [Grades page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/home/assignments) 
Quiz 9 question 1&2 ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/80a07fb3-f965-48f5-b662-876add0313f1/image.png) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1a1b06ae-7cb4-44ea-b9ac-755e0d85ba72/image.png) For first question and second question what is the point here by "all" and "each"In the first question, "all the words" refers to how the system works. In this particular case, the entire document is generated from whatever model is chosen. Therefore the model choice is only made once in the process. So in the first case, our first decision would be to pick the model- and then generate the entire document based on that decision. That would give us   (probability of picking model 1 * probability of generating entire document with the first model) + (probability of picking model 2 * probability of generating document with the second model)  = (0.5 * (0.4 * 0.4)) + (0.5 * (0.1 * 0.1)) = 0.08 + 0.005 = 0.0085  In the second case- we need to choose a model for each word. So every time we want to generate a word, we have to go through the whole process -> 1. pick a model 2. generate a word  This would mean that every time we generate a word we need to take into account the fact that a model needs to be chosen first. This would give us 4 possibilities of how the document is generated: - pick *data* from model 1 and *software* from model 1 - pick *data* from model 2 and *software* from model 2 - pick *data* from model 1 and *software* from model 2 - pick *data* from model 2 and *software* from model 1  we simply have to now add up the probabilities of these 4 possibilities.  (0.5 * 0.4 * 0.5 * 0.4) + (0.5.* 0.1 * 0.5 * 0.1) +  (0.5 * 0.4 * 0.5 * 0.1) + (0.5 * 0.1 * 0.5 * 0.4)  = 0.5 * 0.5 * (0.16 + 0.01 + 0.04 + 0.04) =0.25 * 0.25  =0.625  Hope this helped! I would suggest to keep the quiz post private for others still working on it. 1. We can solve this with the model here for all words using difference is multiplying the background and the document model by the second word. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/7f65739c-bf24-40c3-bd30-d4b0a01cdcc6/image.png) 2.

Why add 1 in log transformations? Why do so many of our log transformations require us to add 1? One example is with IDF(W) as log(M+1). Why not just use M?the reason it is common to add 1 is because what if `M` is equal to 0? `log(0)` is not well defined, so that leads to a computational error. instead, it is safe to add 1 so we know that the minimum log argument we can encounter is 1. not sure if there are particular reasons for the specific IDF case, but in general it is common practice to add one for most cases because of this.  will mark your question as unresolved in case anyone has additional reasons to use this specific transformation If M is the total number of documents in the corpus, and the word appeared in all of the documents, then M/(docs containing term) would be 1.  I would imagine this happens a lot with small words.  The base 2 log would be 0, messing up any calculation you were doing.  So, if you add 1, (M+1)/(docs containing term) could never be 1.
Grader Failing on Scipy My code works perfectly fine in local. I have imported scipy  - "from scipy import stats"  The Grader is complaining about it. When I remove the "from scipy import stats" , then my could wouldn't work.   Has anyone come across this issue and is there a trick to solve it .  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/033d013b-8376-4ba6-b4d8-57ddf75d721f/image.png)the grader does not support scipy. just remove the scipy part in your code and push again For the points of p-value, you don't need to include the calculation code to get those points. Just the significance.txt file is fine. Right. I have changed my code back to its original code in main (remove the test part) then it works. 
Will Exam 2 be Cumulative? Hi,  Will Exam 2 be cumulative over all the lectures/material in the course (Weeks 1-12), or will it mostly just cover the material after Exam 1 (Weeks 7-12)?  Thanks!The Syllabus doesn't explicitly say that it'll be cumulative. It does however say:  " This course will have two 1-hour exams. The exams are intended to test your understanding of the material you learn in the course and will contain questions similar to those seen in the weekly quizzes."  Presumably if both exams are 1 hour, one section covering Text Retrieval / Search Engines, while the 2nd portion of the course from Week 7 to Week 12 are based on Text Mining and Analytics MOOC, the 2nd exam should only cover content from Weeks 7-12. at least from the [Course Introduction Video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/lecture/MsDCs/course-introduction-video), it is stated: > So, the first exam will be given at the end of the first MOOC on Test Retrieval, and the second one will be given at the end of the second MOOC on Text Mining  While some knowledge from the Text Mining MOOC is built off of information from the first half of the semester, this leads me to conclude that the exam will primarily focus on the second half of the semester It will be from week 7-12 I think it is week 7-12. It will probably cover lectures from week 7- 12
M-step i dont understand the m-step formula can someone please detail it for me ?Hey Gabin  for MP3 , we use PLSA so I will focus on EM within PLSA. In class, we generally used PLSA with a background model. For the assignment, there is no background model. Here is the M-Step we were shown in class:  $$\begin{aligned} \pi_{dj}^{(n + 1)} &= \frac{\sum_{w \in V}c(w, d)(1 - p(z_{dw} = B))p(z_{dw} = j)}{\sum_{j'}\sum_{w \in V} c(w,d)(1 - p(z_{dw} = B))p(z_{dw} = j')} \\ p^{(n + 1)}(w| \theta_j) &= \frac{\sum_{d \in C}c(w,d)(1 - p(z_{dw} = B))p(z_{dw} = j)}{\sum_{w' \in V}\sum_{d \in C} c(w', d)(1 - p(z_{dw'} = B))p(z_{dw'} = j)}\end{aligned}$$  so what is this saying? #1196 has a few more details as well. so does #1179 , point 3 in my answer talks a bit more about the normalization step   but at every M-Step, we are calculating two quantities (or really, two matrices): $$\pi_{dj}$$ at the next time step and $$p(w | \theta_j)$$ at the next time step. both of these leverage the E-step results $$p(z_{dw} = j)$$  the first term, $$\pi_{dj}$$, is the document topic probabilities  $$p(z | d)$$. the second term $$p(w| \theta_j)$$ is the topic word probabilities $$p(w | j)$$  luckily, we have a bit of a shortcut. we can ignore the denominator for now which allows us to see that:  $$\begin{aligned} \pi_{dj}^{(n + 1)} &\propto \sum_{w \in V} c(w, d)(1 - p(z_{dw} = B))p(z_{dw} = j) \\ p^{(n + 1)}(w | \theta_j) &\propto \sum_{d \in C} c(w,d)(1 - p(z_{dw} = B))p(z_{dw} = j) \\ where \\ \forall d \in C&; \sum_{j = 1}^k \pi_{dj} = 1 \\ \forall j\in [1,k] &; \sum_{w \in V} p(w | \theta_j) = 1 \end{aligned}$$  the constraints after the "where" inform our normalization step, thus implicitly returning our denominator to us while making some of the calculations simpler.  in other words, we can see that $$\pi_{dj}^{(n + 1)}$$ is proportional to the sum over all the words in the vocabulary of: the count of the terms in the document (given by `d` in $$\pi_{dj}$$) times (1 minus the probability of the background model given `d` and `w` -- this comes from the e-step) times the probability of topic `j` given `d` and `w` (also comes from the e-step)  $$p^{(n + 1)} (w | \theta_j)$$ is proportional to the sum over all the documents in the collection of: the count of `w` in `d` (here the `w` is from $$p(w| \theta_j)$$) times (1 minus the probability of the background model given `d` and `w`) times the probability of topic `j` given `d` and `w`. here `j` also comes from $$p(w | \theta_j)$$  we can further simplify from here to omit the background model, as it is not part of MP3. that makes the equation simpler. finally, we can normalize using the constraints above. fundamentally, the individual quantities we are calculating for both $$\pi_{dj}$$ and $$p(w|\theta_j)$$ are actually the same -- $$c(w,d)$$ and $$p(z_{dw} = j)$$ (this second one comes from the e-step). we just sum them over a different range. in $$\pi_{dj}$$ we sum over every word in the vocabulary. in $$p(w|\theta_j)$$ we sum over all documents in the collection.  please let me know if that made sense. i am happy to discuss further if that wasn't clear or if you have any other questions as well. i am also trying to think of the proper "intuition" to think of these equations more simply, and may update my answer if i can think of it awesome got it now  thanks 
MP2.3 Grade not visible on Coursera Hello Instructors,  I see that I am not the only one with the grade on DataLabs not appearing in Coursera but its been a day since anyone else posted. Has this issue been resolved?  Also, Just to be sure, the autograder in Datalabs looks into both the correctness of score_one function and significance.txt right? So as long as a score of 1 appears that means we got 100%?  Thanks!My Coursera grade also does not seem to be updating.    I have a score of 1 in the livedatalab MP2.3 Leaderboard but only a 70% on Coursera.  I implemented the first part of MP2.3 before I finished the rest a couple of days later. Make sure you navigate from the coursera link for the MP assignment to livedatalab for them to connect. Then I would recommending changing something small in the GitHub (like adding a space) so that you can repost it to make sure it receives it.  My grade on coursera was almost instant with the leaderboard update. See #591 , the same issue has not been resolved yet. I did that multiple times and it wasn't working. Agreed, does not work for me either Zetian. I did an empty commit and went back into livedatalab through Coursera and this time my Coursera grade updated.    I changed nothing except accomplishing an empty commit.  Try this to see if it works for you :) My grade is not reflecting either but I received a score of 1. so I assume it should be updated on coursera soon.  I still have this issue too. Doesnt work for me. Tried multiple times. click open tool in coursera and re-login in livelab. after that do another commit in github, the grade should be available in a minutue Tried multiple times :( as long as you got a score 1 in livedatalab, you dont have to worry about it. Grades can always be added in couresra by TAs manually 
DCG vs nDCG Hi,  while we tend to prefer the nDCG to DCG. I came across the following limitations of nDCG from wiki:  1. Normalized DCG metric does not penalize for bad documents in the result 2. Normalized DCG does not penalize for missing documents in the result 3. Normalized DCG may not be suitable to measure performance of queries that may often have several equally good results  How to overcome these limitations in practical terms?The explanation from [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain#:~:text=0.785-,Limitations,-%5Bedit%5D) might answer this question.  > Normalized DCG metric does not penalize for bad documents in the result  We can penalize bad documents by setting the scores 1, 0, and -1 instead of 2,1, and 0.  > Normalized DCG does not penalize for missing documents in the result  We can penalize missing documents by enforcing a fixed set size for the result set.   > Normalized DCG may not be suitable to measure performance of queries that may often have several equally good results  This seems to be especially true when this metric is limited to only the first few results. So a possible workaround might be to increase a result set size, although this change can sometimes be unpreferable.  
CS 410 DL Hi,  I presume that the content so far studied in week1 , week2  and possibly week3 corresponding references over the internet are only required to be submitted in this DL right?  Please advise.There is no required content with respect to the week. For example, if you're already on week 5 and have found something useful, you can submit that for MP2.1. Moreover, you'll still be able to submit content once MP2.1 is over (we encourage you to do so throughout the semester, in the case that you come across a useful reference).  Thank you! No problem!
Webhook not seen Hello,   I was wondering if I should be able to see my webhook after creating it.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/fdb64fba-7c50-4bc5-b6a4-f69efa5f48f2/image.png)  After clicking "Add webhook" multiple times, I still do not see the webhook. I've tried this a few times, but my list of webhooks is empty. Does anyone know how to go about fixing this?   Here is an image of my webhook which is where I believe I'm supposed to see if it gets successfull added:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/646bee87-a76f-4e90-a4bd-ec693f1625d6/image.png)   Hey, yes you should be able to see the webhook after creating it.

Question for Quiz 2 can anyone explain the logics behind?🥺 "If Zipf's law does not hold, will an inverted index be much faster or slower?"  The answer is slowerZipf's law tells us that highly-ranked words have low frequency. If Zipf's law does not hold, we would expect highly ranked words to have higher frequency. High-frequency words, such as stop words, take up a lot of space in an inverted index. So, if Zipf's law does not hold, we would expect an inverted index to become bigger and therefore slower. The inverted index takes advantage of the fact that most of the higher ranked words tend to occur rarely. This idea comes from Zipf's law. However, if this is not true, then inverted index will start suffering from the need for more space and time
Password Exam on Coursera I don't quite understand, what kind of things should I type in the answer box there.This is for your proctor to input when you take the exam. You have to schedule a proctor session via proctor U and the proctor has the password to the exam. Once the proctor inputs the password into that password quiz, the actual exam quiz will be unlocked which you can then take. So I'm supposed to ignore this before I actually start taking the test? Yup this is purely for the exam. The proctor will know what to do. 
question about smoothing method In the lecture, it mentioned that we can use the collection language model to do the smoothing. Not sure if I missed anything in the lecture, but in practice, when we run the retrieval engine, the only information we know is the user query. in this case, how do we know which collection language model we will use? do we need to have a separate model to identify the "collection" of each query? Thank you! Actually, you have a bit more information than the user query at retrieval time. You have your entire collection at that point. The user is writing a query to retrieve hopefully relevant documents from your collection. For example, in the case of Google, the collection is the entirety of the indexed web (give or take). Your collection may be tailored to a specific use case; for example the CS410DL search engine we are building is more specific to the Text Information field, instead of Google's more general scope. By using the statistics of our collection, we can then build the relevant metrics. There are also more general corpuses that have these unigram word probabilities, like the background model, or topic specific models (ie for NLP or for Nutrition). These are usually pre-defined by some other collection, and we can leverage those pre-calculated language models That makes a lot of sense. Thank you! May I know why in section 5.3 Feedback in LM, in the generative mixture model, we use background model instead of collection model? I am always confused about when should we use collection model or background model. Screen Shot 2022-09-21 at 3.59.06 PM![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%203.59.06%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ff50d8e2-74ad-4ce9-ace0-4ff4d3812bda/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%203.59.06%20PM.png) Hey Yu; I'm actually going through Week 5 right now myself, so I will amend my answer once I get to 5.3 (may not be until tomorrow, but I will update when I get there). However, in general, my belief is that it probably comes down to what your purpose is. Using the general background model has more utility for more use cases, and so is more widely applicable. Topic specific LMs are beneficial when you know you plan to limit your domain a bit more. However, with the generative mixture model I imagine there is something slightly more complex at work so I will update as I progress and think this through. Definitely an interesting question!  Also, I've amended my original answer slightly to provide a little more context for now Thanks a lot. Take your time, feel free to let me know if there is any update. Hey Yu; I think I've gotten a better sense now for how this works in the Generative Mixture Model and the reasoning here; In the Generative Mixture Model, we assume that the terms in the feedback documents are generated from one of two models. When we choose to generate a term for a document, we select which model generates that term randomly. Let's assume the case where $$\lambda = 0$$; in other words, all the terms in the feedback document are generated from the `Topic LM`. Well, this actually presents a problem.  To understand why, I want to clarify that we do not yet know the `Topic LM` probabilities. We actually build the probabilities based off of the feedback document. Thus, if $$\lambda = 0$$, we create the `Topic LM` from the term frequencies in the feedback documents (using Maximum Likelihood). The problem comes, then, when we consider what terms will be most common in the Feedback Documents. It will be stop words (`the`, `and`, etc). So, we want to mix in another model that is able to implicitly remove the stop words from the `Topic LM` for us.   In this case, we know that the `Background LM` tells us what words are common in general. And what we want to remove are the words that are most common **in general**. If we used something more specific here, we may actually end up filtering relevant terms (for example if we are interested in a computer topic and used a `Collection LM` based on computer science papers, we may end up filtering out terms like "computer" or "software", which is undesirable). Since the most common stop words are represented best by the `Background LM` in this case then, it is the best choice for removing those common terms without filtering too aggressively.  So, when $$\lambda > 0$$, we can attribute the most common words in the feedback documents that are also common in the `Background LM` to the `Background LM`. The remaining terms will get attributed to the `Topic LM`. This effectively allows us to remove stop words.  So, we use the `Background LM` here because it is very general, and contains the most common stop words which we want to remove from the `Topic LM`.  By trying different probabilities for we can maximize the log likelihood for $$p(F | \theta)$$ at a given $$\lambda$$ value (which means we are trying different probability distributions for the `Topic LM` to perform that maximization over $$\theta$$)  More generally, and to succinctly answer you question **the Background LM seems to be the best choice for stop-word removal because of its generality**, which is also basically its purpose in the Generative Mixture Model  I am happy to elaborate a bit more if I missed anything or if there are further questions. Please let me know if that all made sense. Thanks!
Question about tasks in MP2.3 I am confused about if I get all tasks needed to be completed in MP2.3. Firstly, we need to modify function at  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4c4eabe2-1d55-4a80-b306-7eee173c86df/image.png) according to the formula, right? But some variables in the formula is missing, ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1785be3e-35ba-4e5f-ac19-230c9d8f28d2/image.png)like c(t, Q). How should we compute them? Secondly, we need to change the ranker ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9a521f13-fe7c-482e-a60c-16bda117e1ef/image.png) Then we need to conduct the significance test, right? Hello Anonymous, We have been asked first to modify score_one to use one of the ranker functions presented in the lectures, such as Jelinek-Mercer or BM25. We need the output of this step for the significance test. Second, we have been asked to modify the return value of score_one to match the formulas provided. All of the necessary variables, including c(t,Q), are available through the sd object, although you may need to read carefully the descriptions at the link beginning with https://meta-toolkit.org.  Finally, we are asked to compare the results from the above two steps, using a paired t-test. How we run the t-test is up to us. David c(t,Q) means count of terms in query I fixed it. Thank you! Thank you Hi David:  Please correct me if i'm wrong - so step 2 is to modify load_ranker() to make it return InL2 ranker or NM25 ranker? step 3 is to modify main() to make it create those three .txt and save them to working dir?  Hello SiCheng,  Yes. As mentioned in README.md, we are asked to change the ranker at least twice. We are asked first to change it to one of the five metapy methods such as OkapiBM25 or DirichletPrior (along with our choice of parameters). Later we are asked to change load_ranker to call InL2.   Step 3 can be achieved more than one way. For example, one could modify the program to write the average precision values to a text file, as you indicated. Or, one could copy-and-paste the console output to create a text file. Key points, in order to make a paired T-test analysis, are that the two text files should contain only numbers, and the two files should contain the same quantity of numbers.   I hope this is helpful. David
Deadline mismatches! When is team formation due and how do we submit our team formations?

Memorizing Equations for Exam 1 Since no cheatsheets are allowed for the exams, do we need to memorize equations for exams? Such as the smoothing function for statistical language model, or the gamma integer compression algorithm? Cuz I saw we have questions on quizzes require those equations.In general, you should not need to make effort to memorize anything. That said, there are some simple formulas that you are expected to fully understand. Once you understand them, you should naturally be able to write it down and shouldn't need to make any effort to memorize it. For example, you are expected to fully understand the formulas of precision, recall, average precision, and F1. If you fully understand them, you will find it easy to write down the formulas yourself (based on your understand). You don't need to remember nDCG (since it's log-based discounting is a somewhat arbitrary way of doing it, and there's really nothing there to understand except for the idea of discounting based on positions), but you should also know the ideas behind nDCG. You mentioned smoothing, which is an important technique, so you are also expected to fully understand Dirichlet prior smoothing and the JM smoothing (linear interpolation). Again, once you fully understand how they work, it should be straightforward to write down the formulas on your own. And yes, you should know how gamma coding works. In sum, focus on *understanding*, rather than memorization.   In general, you can refer to the last slide of a lecture that says something like "what you should know" to see what you are expected to understand.     Thanks for the guidance professor. The last summary slide 6.10 talks about HITS and learning to Rank which are covered in the optional lectures. Should we expect questions on the optional lectures as well? I found this study guide in slack the other day... hope it helps:  https://uiuc-mcsds.slack.com/files/U59M5H83W/F7JHBRF61/cs410exam1.pdf In case you can't open that file directly (like I couldn't), you can also search for it in Slack here: ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-14%20at%2012.48.32.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1d116df1-68e8-450b-a78c-3d09eb61ece2/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-14%20at%2012.48.32.png) Thanks for this.

Writing InL2 function In the readme.md file it is mentioned to go over the following link to understand the retrieval function. I am not able to get access to this citation.  "You will now implement a retrieval function called InL2. It is described in (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=582416) paper: "  is it required to over this paper to know how to implement this function ?     The equation is shown in the instruction. You just write python code to implement the equation. I don’t think you need to read this paper just for purpose of the assignment  You only need the formula, which is given in the readme/assignment overview. The paper (and the linked GitHub repo) will help if you get stuck on how to map formula parameters to the `sd` object variables, though! You don't need to go over the paper. The readme on github includes a picture of the equation. You need to implement that equation in the space given
Spoiler alert: issues running metapy on python 3.7 for MP2.3 Hopefully this will save people some time.   It appears the ranker.score function will run indefinitely on python 3.7. I downgraded python to 3.5 and issue resolved. (Though it's a different battle to install correct ipykernel for visual studio code for python 3.5.... )My togo solution is to use docker with rosseta installed on if apple silicon. Python version won't make any differences. I noticed the same issue :-(. Were you able to downgrade your python using anaconda? I have M1 macbook and I cannot downgrade python to 3.5.. ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-16%20at%202.35.44%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/dba47f9d-3f5c-4a5c-bfbe-05c1cad54e1d/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-16%20at%202.35.44%20PM.png)  . .

about the query term in KL divergence model Hi, I have a little hard time to understand exact what this term means, and how it is different from c(w,q) in the query likelihood model. In Query likelihood and KL-divergence, both terms refer to the query users use to search :![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/89e008d8-add2-4034-af7f-7eb8d6d616cc/image.png)I think that $${\hat\theta_Q} $$ is the query language model updated after feedback.  All of the various $$\theta$$s throughout the text are language models containing the probability of all the words in the model.  c(w, q) is just number of copies of word w in query q.
Midterm Setup Confusion I saw before on ProctorU that you're supposed to have a mirror or something?? I don't have any way to get a mirror next to my desk.  I saw that if you don't have a mirror, you need a phone. Can someone explain the setup?  Is it just like when we take normal exams over Zoom and the proctor has to be able to see my computer screen and my paper? Or is it similar to Proctorio where you need to move your laptop around sometimes and your desk has to be clear?   I want to know what I need for the exam and if I need to clean my room or my desk or something.  Also, will we be able to use the built-in laptop calculator or anything?Please keep you phone with you. Please follow their instructions.   The proctor need something to check your environment, either your front cam of your phone or a web camera should be ok. They asked me to move my web camera 360 degrees to check all room corners. He/She also want to see where you put your phone. To add to previous answeres. No you do not have any built-in calculator. And for using mirror or phone to show your desktop and room, you only show that once before the exam. One tip would be to avoid setting close to your normal desk with additional displays/screens, even if they are not connected to your computer/laptop. There is a chance you might be asked to put the displays away. It depends on the proctor and won't always happen, but it would be a pain if it does. Use your phone, mirror not required. No calculator is allowed.  Yes, it is just like taking your exam over zoom. They want to make sure they can see all around you. They may even ask you to pick up your laptop and show them the whole room.
Question Regarding Project Progress Report Hi,   I was wondering if there is any additional requirement for the project progress reports besides: - the progress made - remaining tasks - any challenges/issues being faced  Does it have any additional requirements such as format, and the minimum number of pages?  ThanksNo, there is no format or minimum number of pages requirement. However, the completion grade is based off of sufficiently answering each question, so we expect that this will require 1-2 pages total.  Thank you so much for the clarification. 
Leaderboard - Does not load on Livedatalab For some reason the leaderboard does not load for me. It continues to show loading.....  Any one facing the same issue ?Can you try relinking your GitHub again (removing the link from livedatalab and adding again). It seems like you passed the tests but the leaderboard is not updating. If that doesn’t work, I can manually update your coursera grade.  I just did it again. Deleted the linked account, added the account again. Made a push on the MP1 code to github. The logs shows SUCCESS ! But leaderboard is still not loadind and I also dont see the grade in Coursera. It shows as If I have not completed my assignment. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/fa6a7e2a-71ae-417a-baa8-5d52df733710/image.png) I've updated the grade on coursera thank you !! It shows like this now.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/68e2a078-4476-4104-9b98-adb8be90e9b6/image.png) Hello. I may know why you have that issue. I was having the same problem.  When I was initially looking for the Leaderboard in "LiveDataLab", I accidentally went up to "Create" and then selected "Leaderboard", which gets stuck on loading.   If you did this, try this approach. Go to Projects -> MP1. You should see leaderboard on the left.   ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%206.30.10%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/5f996da5-764e-4060-95eb-3e47675a673f/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%206.30.10%20PM.png) Thank you Anshul. I was able to see it the way you mentioned. !! Hello Priyanka, Can I request a grade update on Coursera? I have the MP1 status as success (1 in the Leaderboard), but Coursera is indicating the assignment as late at this time. Thanks  
success on ping and fail on push deliever ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3821f7e2-5d58-4b14-a59e-17671764f0e3/image.png) I set up the webhook with the correct link start with livedatalab. I did success on the ping but once i push my code to github, it doesn't shows up and grade for me i also had the same `Github Account Not Found` error as you had. While your case may be different, for me I had to use my **exact** username in github (case sensitive) as the host name when adding the github account (with the token) to the livedatalab. What messed me up was the case sensitivity my github account are all lowercases and i type my name to livedatalab are all lowercase. But it still doesn't work ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/205808b0-5ab9-4626-b2a3-97df53d18e94/image.png) The picture is the error return by livedatalab when i push my code to github. Can you try to delete the webhook and re-add it?  Yes, i tried to delete the webhook and re-add it manytimes, it only works on the first times Can you try relinking your github account? It's likely the repository is not accessible? What is the name of your repo for MP1?   If this doesn't work, I would suggest recreating a livedatalab account and resubmitting --- you might have missed a step from before.  Yes, I had relinkede my account yesterday, and it doesn't work, I alreayd have gread and post on the coursera. If i recreat another account, will that affect my grade ? the repo for MP1 is MP1_private  No I think it should be fine. Just make sure you use your illinois email when registering for a new account. saw the same error, too. It means LiveDataLab is not connected to your GitHub account. a couple things to try - put this in browser `https://api.github.com/users/{{github_usename}}` if a JSON object shows up, `github_username` is correct and is what to use linking LiveDataLab - make sure host domain is lowercase in LiveDataLab like `github.com`. Sometimes it got auto-corrected to uppercase - if still not work, unlink it, refresh the page, and link again with a new token  Good Luck~ Thank you so much, but when i put the `https://api.github.com/users/{{github_usename}}` in browser, it reuturns  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ce701d50-fffa-4dcc-a0be-cc3fdb481e79/image.png) replace `{{github_usename}}` with the value you used in LiveDataLab. It's just a step to make sure you are using the correct username. If still error, then you are using the wrong GitHub username this api return a JSON object and it is what i linked on the livedatalab OK, I fixed thhis problem. The reason of this becasue i add my another account ad contributor. 
deadline for project progress report Hi I find on coursera w13 is for us to do group project, however the deadline for project progress report is Nov13, which is the end of w12, is this deadline correct？yes, the progress report deadline is Nov 13. working on the course project starts as soon as you submit your proposal, all the way through the final submission deadline. w13 just doesn't have any other material covered, that's why its description is " work on group project"
Grading failed? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/11a9d202-1753-4797-91fb-1e29587a51eb/image.png)  Why it is showing using python 3.7? I don't think I use python 3.7 anywhere. My computer environment use python 3.5 and I was able to execute all the instruction steps.I used 3.7 and it works. In the log it says "tok" is not defined. In your code, did you define tok as the parameter? It turns out to be a "code error", which means I am failed to execute my code in my local computer. So I definitely won't expect a success from the grading either. I have corrected my code and managed to solve the issue.   My lesson learned: try to execute it on my local and make it a success run first.
Mp 2.2 is Overdue I have submitted 7 queries yesterday but still  It's showing assignment is overdue.  As per the instruction , I should get full credit for submitting at-least 5 queries.   ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-18%20at%2011.03.42%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d341d3f5-c884-40de-b799-f50e15d9cf08/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-18%20at%2011.03.42%20PM.png)  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-18%20at%2011.15.08%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/0616d4b7-1dde-4f0a-bfd3-e95d3002f1b1/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-18%20at%2011.15.08%20PM.png) The grading for MP2.2 is similar to that of MP2.1. This is what it says in the overview document. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c79c3d5c-0bbf-4956-a90f-af1e8f01b8fa/image.png)  There was a similar clarification for this query for MP2.1 #438  coursera indicates it as overdue as no submission was received before the deadline. it's normal and you'll see your score after the TA team updates it in coursera. it's the same as MP2.1. Mine shows the same. I think it may get updated as soon as TAs update the grades. And you typically get an email once you receive new grade I believe this to be true for all who have submitted; it may take some time to populate a score and that the assignment is overdue until the TA's are finished assigning all grades. I have learned to take lightly the information displayed in Coursera
Directions for PDF of the proposal? From the context of the instructions, it seems like we have to make some kind of write-up with the proposal of our project. However, I can't find any instructions regarding that, I can only see the instructions for team signup and CMT submission. If we do, could you tell me where to find the instruction for the write-up? What do we need to include in our proposal PDF?  Thanks!The content to include in your proposal PDF is determined by your topic. Please see [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-EagO17Og7_ESj5hkP5x4EFrVPQAtBlH9YvsgEzjnY/edit?usp=sharing ), navigate to your topic, and see the "Requirements" subsection for what to include in the proposal. 
Grade still not visible in Coursera The rank and score on LiveDataLab is 1 but it is still not updating on coursera.   Just wanted to confirm if LiveDataLab scores are enough for us to receive the full gradeYou should receive the full grade when TAs verify but if you do an empty commit through VS Code or a minor commit through Github like adding a space, you should be able to log back into livedatalab and the score should update. Should be updated now Thank you, will try that next time Thank you! same here! the grade is not visible in Coursera I still dont see a grade on coursera. I see an "Overdue" for MP2.3. Just want to make sure I will get a 100% with a score of 1 on live data lab. Thank you. I don't see a grade in Coursera either. Please kindly advise. Thanks in advance! 
Question about MP3 I am currently computing the E-step. I simply use np.dot(self.document_topic_prob, self.topic_word_prob) to get the numerator part of the e-step equation. The denominator is the sum of this dot product. The shape is (1000, 6) eventually, which I feel is reasonable. However, the shape of p(z|d, w) should be (1000, 2, 6). It means that my shape is incorrect. I am not sure what is the problem. Can I get some hint please? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6bb7ee51-3a3c-4b6a-9d5b-644f8403f867/image.png) Maybe think of *. I am sorry. I do not really understand. Could you explain more please? What is *. elementwise multiplication Thank you for the reply. I see your point. However, the shape of P(z | d) is (1000, 2) and P(w | z) is (2, 6). Since their shape is not the same. How does the element-wise multiplication work? unless my shape of P(z | d) and P(w | z) are not correct when I created them. Maybe you can think of reshaping the matrix to achieve that, but I'm using the for loop instead. It was useful for me to first write down for loops on paper and then convert them to numpy transformations. Instead of directly converting the formula to numpy matrix transformations, just try out  formula -> for loop -> numpy. That was very useful for me. Thank you so much. I will try it Thank you for the hint, I will try using for loop as well Resolved?  yes
Final Project -Intelligent Browsing Hello,  Our group chose Interllegent browing for our project topic for now and we are interested in web extension. To what extend do professional expect our web extension to performance. If we are working on web extension, how large the dataset is expected to be? Are we going to implement a new ranking function or we can use functions from Metapy?The expectation is that you and your group (size N) will spend ~20*N hours on the project. There is no specific expectation on data set size or ranking function selection.

Okapi BM25 Model - question about denominator In the denominator (c(w,d) + k), should it not be in brackets instead of just k being multiplied to document length normalizer?  Reference from book (Chapter 6 Retrieval Models, page 108) ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-10%20at%202.10.06%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3a094dda-fe25-442f-9012-a0ec1c029a70/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-10%20at%202.10.06%20PM.png)I think the formula mentioned in the image is correct as BM25. I was thinking since “c(w, d) + k” being part of bm25 transformation denominator so the whole term should have been multiplied by the document length normalizer. Not sure if I missed something. Oh, I see, but it makes the meaning of each term totally different.  $$\frac{(k+1)x}{x+k}$$ is the basic sub-linear transformation for $$x$$ with the upper limit $$k+1$$.   $$\frac{(k+1)x}{norm*(x+k)}$$ changes the upper limit with respect to $$norm$$.  On the other hand, $$\frac{(k+1)x}{x+norm*k}$$ does not change the upper limit of $$k+1$$.  I think you can comprehend this difference with this toy. https://www.desmos.com/calculator  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/afa58ffb-86d6-4de0-bc62-fe3b89592e31/image.png)   Thanks!

need more help with EM algorithm I have a hard time to figure the dimensions of the terms and the matrix operations among them.  if I use d,w,t to represent the dimensions of document, words,and topics and use the term notation in the MP3 code,  I think P(z | d) is matrix of dimension (d, t), #d of rows and #t of columns.  P(w | z) is a matrix of dimension (t, w), #t of rows and # w of columns.  1) what is the dimension of P(z | d, w)?  in the lecture note as below, ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/20f1058d-76f1-4b12-84d4-bebd26255be5/image.png)  the ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/458609c7-e28a-4a5f-b057-6c8ac485f56d/image.png) can be mapped to P(z | d), and the ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6b8170ca-b998-45a6-87a2-7637e5052e7f/image.png) is P(w | z),  but how to do the matrix multiplication between P(z | d) and P(w | z)  to satisfy the equation above?  it is not a dot product between P(z | d) and P(w | z).  And I don't think the element wise multiplication between P(z | d) and P(w | z) can work because of the dimension mismatch. Please give some hints. Thanks!If you are not familiar with numpy matrix operation you can think about using the for loop. no, I am not going to use the for loop. It is more troublesome.  is P(z | d, w) still 2D matrix????? 3D I would suggest to check how the numpy matrix operation works, think about a smaller doc set and try some smaller matrix first. is there any right topic thread I can read outside the campuswire? Thanks! The dimension of p(z|d, w) is d, t, w (3-dimensional).  If you feel dot product or matrix multiplication cannot calculate in one-step, you may consider to use for loop. The formula shows how to calculate for each individual d, t, w. I can suggest you using matrix multiplication to get the denominators (or directly use normalize function) and using for loop to get topic_prob.  I did it, not as bad as it seemed..
MP 2.3 Question What does $$|D|$$ mean in the tfn function?

DBLP Topics + Labels I completed MP3 without issue, but was interested in extending the learning experience by experimenting with the DBLP dataset.  - Is there an optimal number of topics for this dataset?   - Are there any training labels you could provide?  Initial experiments with DBLP indicate it would be advantageous to use a tokenizer/vectorizer to build the term doc matrix due to the size of the corpus/vocabulary.    However, subsequent matrix multiplication operations are difficult even with only 2 topics because of high memory requirements.   - In practice, should we use stop words and/or max features size to limit the size of the term doc matrix? - Additionally is there a straightforward way to implement the PLSA algorithm without the need for the 3d topic prob matrix?  My intuition is that the 3d topic prob matrix could be replaced by (2) 2d matrices, which would be very helpful  for matrix operations.  This would also allow sparse matrix functionality, which only supports 2d.  
Practice question: 3.6 Hey, just wondering, for the context of this question:" an automatic system that filters tweets in the search for possible communication between terrorists about attack plans on US soil" - due to the extremely high stake if any terrorist communication somehow is missed, I would guess we are looking for a very high recall, which means we would rather sacrificing the accuracy, but to make sure we keep as many relevant tweets as possible - as we have such bias, doesn't it mean we would prefer lower F-score, because F-score is trying to balance between accuracy and recall. Or one step further, is there any context in which we would prefer a low F-score?Yes, this example seems to be looking for a high recall so that all the communication tweets are listed even if that means the ranking of such tweets is not very precise. Having higher beta value supports such usecases. If it helps, can refer to https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/386 In my opinion, F1-score, Recall and Precision are all important metrics when we evaluate the result. In this case, we pay more attention to Recall, so it will reduce F1-score to a certain extent. However, we cannot just prefer the lowest F1-score. We can give Recall a larger weight and weight the three metrics to evaluate the result. As many have said, F score is a balance between accuracy and recall (not an average). I believe we always prefer higher for accuracy, recall as well as F score,  but we cannot have them all. In this specific terrorist case, I believe we should prefer high recall and F score, while lower accuracy is acceptable.  I havent seen a case where lower F score (which means both accuracy and recall are low) is desired though. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score#F%CE%B2_score), recall is considered $$\beta$$ times as important as precision. Therefore, if recall is more important (as it is here), we want a high value of $$\beta$$.
Question on paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations Hello,  In the book, Chapter 13.2, page 281, and also in the slides it is mentioned that  > This also shows some interesting connections between the discovery of syntagmatic relations and paradigmatic relations. Specifically, words that are paradigmatically related tend to have a syntagmatic relation with **the same word**.   I am quite confused on comprehending the relationship between paradigmatic and syntagmatic. Especially in the last sentence. What exactly do the words **"the same word"** reference to?  Would any one have a good example that helps explaining this relationship please? Thank youExample: 'Car' and 'Bus' have a paradigmatic relationship because they belong to the same class (they are both vehicles) and can occur at the same locations in a sentence. 'Car' has a syntagmatic relationship with 'Drive' as they are co-occurring elements.  'Bus' has a syntagmatic relationship with 'Drive' as they are also co-occurring elements. So two words that have a paradigmatic relationship ('Car' and 'Bus') have a syntagmatic relationship with the same word ('Drive'). Oh I see it now, what a great example. Thank you!
Question about section 5.2 In section 5.2 slides page 7, it mentioned that Rocchio method can be used for relevance feedback and pseudo feedback. May I know why this method cannot be used in implicit feedback? Screen Shot 2022-09-21 at 9.07.51 ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%209.07.51%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/44c411a5-63d4-43f3-afc9-763bdccfcb1d/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%209.07.51%20PM.png) My assumption is that, the tags coming from implicit feedback is not very trustworthy. For example, some non-relevant docs still get clicked just because it is one of those top ranked result (maybe this can be solved by using long click through rate instead of click through rate); while some relevant docs doesn't get clicked just because they are ranked to the bottom of the result and user already find what they need. But the pseudo feedback also has the same problem of inaccuracy of tag. So I am quite curious about why Rocchio is not suitable for implicit feedback.  By the way, I feel that to improve the performance of retrieval engine depends on not only the algorithm to incorporating the feedback information, but also the signal quality of feedback collection mechanism, given that the judgement might not be reliable in pseudo/ implicit feedback but relevance feedback is a luxury to have in most case.  So in practice, is there any way to tell us which part is the major blocker of the retrieval engine performance? Thus we can decide what should be our next step, we need to try some new algorithm? or we actually need to pay some money to the human raters in order to improve the quality of feedback data? Thanks.I think your intuition is correct. In the case of relevance feedback, we obviously have the user judgements. In the case of pseudorelevance feedback, we only take into account the top $$k$$ ranked results, with the assumption that the top-ranked results are likely relevant (and if not, perhaps they have some degree of similarity at the very least) - our relevance analysis here is bound to a subset of the top-ranked results. In the case of implicit feedback, there are no such "reasonable" constraints to make such an assumption - perhaps the user decided to click on only the lowest ranked results for some reason, in which case the feedback would be incorrectly interpreted.  Also, recall that from the Rocchio discussion in section 5.2, non-relevant documents tend to be positionally scattered (when considering the documents in a 2D space) as opposed to relevant documents which tend to be positionally clustered, meaning that a few negative examples do not have an overly significant weight in influencing the updated query vector away from the desired position. thanks for your reply. I noticed that in quiz 5, it mentioned the least reliable method is pseudo feedback.. so I am not sure if it is really just because of implicit feedback is not reliable.... Screen Shot 2022-09-21 at 9.03.32 PM![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%209.03.32%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/32fcb5ab-31c3-44df-90cf-217eba26dabb/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%209.03.32%20PM.png) Hello Yu, I think the feedback mechanisms can be understood this way: - Relevance feedback is the most reliable, because users passed judgment on the documents themselves. In other words, this method has the greatest input from actual users. - Implicit feedback is the next most reliable, because user click-throughs indicate which documents "look" reliable in the search results. So there is some user input, but only on the headline or snippet presented by the search engine. - Pseudo-feedback is the least reliable, because there is no user interaction at all. It's a kind of circular logic: the search engine says the top k documents are the most relevant, therefore those documents must be the most relevant.  Implicit feedback is actually more reliable than pseudo.
What type of demo is expected to be given for final project? Hi TA and Prof,  We have a question regarding the requirement of the final project. The [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-EagO17Og7_ESj5hkP5x4EFrVPQAtBlH9YvsgEzjnY/edit#) says we are required to provide a "demo". What is the types of the demo is expected? Does it need to be an interface like an interactable webpage, or just a demonstration that the code can run (like training codes or data generation codes)?  Thanks!The demo requirements depend on the project topic. For example, if you propose a new ML model, then the demo might be some basic inference on a small test set. If you propose a Chrome extension, then the demo may be you screen-recording how a user would walk through its use. 
Proposal Length How long is our proposal supposed to be? A single page? Single or double spaced?There is no length or format requirement - just take as much space as necessary to answer the required questions. But a good rule of thumb is that it should probably be longer than a single page, as that probably means you have included enough information to answer everything.  The requirement lets us to write roughly one page and it give us some questions to answer.
Dropped Status in Quiz 3 and Quiz 4 Hello,  Does anyone know why the status of Quiz 3 and 4 is "Dropped"? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6d91351f-fc3b-48ea-80bc-68b55baa3ab5/image.png)  I remember they were in "Graded" before, am I the only one or do you have the same status?  Thanks!Only the top 10 quiz scores are graded, so your lowest two scores are dropped. For me it shows as graded. Oh I see, thanks for explanation!
Quiz 4 Problem can someone help to explain this question ? From my understanding, the purpose of smoothing is ensure a unseen word will have a non-zero probability. ![%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2022-10-15%20%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%881.00.35.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a289443b-7324-412a-a75a-5265f14c00d1/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2022-10-15%20%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%881.00.35.png)You are correct: smoothing prevents unseen words from having zero probability. Because if p(w|d) = 0, then log p(w|d) is undefined and therefore likelihood is undefined. (It's not clear how "undefined" and "minus infinity" are equivalent, but all answer choices say the same. So we only need to consider the "if a term" piece of the answer choices.) Thanks! The asymptotic behavior is that is tends to negative infinity as the probability tends to 0, but they just saved some words, at the expense of being less mathematically precise. I don't think this is a course where that type of pedantry is of much value.
May I ask correct answer of Q2 #2? Unfortunately, I ended up solving problem #2 of quiz 2 wrong.  May I ask correct answer of Q2 #2?  The problem is,  Let w1, w2, and w3 represent three words in the dictionary of an inverted index. Suppose we have the following document frequency distribution: w1 : 1000 w2 : 100 w3 : 10  Question 2 If we enter the query Q= “w1 w2” then the minimum possible number of accumulators needed to score all the matching documents is:  Is correct answer 1000? (Because we need to check at least 1000 document for the w1 in query)  If not, could you explain a little bit about this problem?  Thank you!The video for [Lesson 2.6: System Implementation - Fast Search](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/lecture/QKK7y/lesson-2-6-system-implementation-fast-search), starting at 5:45 gives very good example of this. It's a two-term query, "info security", where "info" matches 5 different documents and "security" matches 3 different documents.  The example starts by allocating 5 accumulators (each accumulator is the running total of count of relevant terms for a given document), and then walking through the postings, updating a given accumulator if that document contains the term per the posting table. After the first term is fully accounted for, the example walks through the postings for the term (starting at timestamp 8:00). Notice that when both terms appear in the same document, the same accumulator is updated.  The worst case is if w1 and w2 don't appear in any of the same documents, because we would need to instantiate 1100 accumulators (one per document). Since we use one accumulator per document, if both terms appear in the same document, we can reuse the accumulator.  I hope this helps. There must be a separate accumulator for each document containing one or more of the query words.  Suppose each document contains only one of the query words. In other words, 1000 documents contain only w1 and do not contain w2, and 100 other documents contain only w2 and do not contain w1. Then we need the __maximum__ possible number of accumulators = 1000 + 100 = 1100. Now suppose that every document containing w2 also contains w1. In other words, 100 documents contain w2 and w1, and 900 more documents contain w1 only. Then we need the __minimum__ number of accumulators = max (1000,100) = 1000.  I hope this is helpful.

Question about Reduce function How many times is the reduce funtion called? According to the first slide, it seems like there is only one reduce function to process all the KV pairs. But later it says each reduce function handles a unique key.   ![1.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/5dc8e26c-97e8-4102-967a-5dd5f2f1a0ba/1.png)![2.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1c25e6b5-a333-4b38-99fd-e91025538823/2.png)A reducer is **usually** called once for each unique key. In the second slide, 3 different reducers are called and each is only called once. Depends on the resource manager, one reducer can also take more than one tasks. You can search more about MapReduce. Hope it helps! As already explained in the following post, the Reduce function is called once for each unique key. In general, there will be multiple unique key values, thus in our case, there will be many many instances of the Reduce function being executed simultaneously in parallel and on different machines. This is why we could speed up the indexing process.  Thanks for the detailed explanation. My question has been perfectly solved.

I think the first choice (selected) should be correct. could anyone comment on the second option "topic are a mixture of words where the mixing weight depends not only on the topics but also the documents"? Why is wrong? I believe "mixing weight" means parameters such as λB (percentage of background words) and (1 - λB) that we see in the E-M equations. So documents have no direct influence on the mixing weight.

still didn't see the score for proposal submission anything do i need to do? are we still waiting for the scores to be input onto coursera?I'm still waiting for my grade/meta-review as well. The TAs said they would give an update when the process is complete, so I suppose they're still working. In the meantime, I'm just moving forward with the proposed project since the peer reviews were positive - after all, the progress report is due in under two weeks... Same here. We need the TA's reviews before we can start the project. We are still working on grading all projects. In the interest of time, please move forward with your proposal.

How to get access to tech review sign up sheet with uiuc email？ Hi I'm trying to log in to the Google sheet for topic proposal of tech review but it always ask me to sign in with a Google email which doesn't have access to it, how can I log in with my uiuc's outlook email？It seems to open when I am logged in with my Illinois email. Can you try again? For those have the same issues( maybe just a problem for new students) I have figure it out  by doing these  https://cloud-dashboard.illinois.edu/   turn on your GoogleApp service, then open  g.illinois.edu   and select gmail, it'll ask you to verify your Illinois email and save your profile to Chrome. After doing this you'll be directly log in to Google sheet when you click those links Thanks! This instruction is really helpful. It also addresses my problem that I cannot log in my uiuc email through Outlook recently.
How to Compute IDF? Hi,   In lecture 2.1, we have been provided the formula to compute IDF as: $$ IDF\left ( W \right ) = log\left ( \frac{M + 1}{k} \right ) $$  In the example inside of the slide, it shows: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3b00f5f1-989d-4066-99c2-bec3bfc6adea/image.png)  Given we have a corpus: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f86e1698-09b9-4e8d-9fff-2a98be2ab953/image.png)  Should the IDF for the word `news` be: $$ IDF\left ( \mathrm{"news"} \right ) = log\left ( \frac{M + 1}{k} \right ) = log\left ( \frac{5 + 1}{5} \right ) = 0.263 $$ instead of `1.5` ?  Sorry if I misunderstand something.   ThanksFrom what I understand, the values given in the slides are just indicative examples. They're not actual calculations done on the documents. As far as your understanding of the function and calculation is concerned, I think that is on point. I see... thank you so much.
Lesson 4.2: Total N-1 Parameters in Unigram LM? Hi, in lesson 4.2, when professor Zhai talking about the number of the parameters of unigram LM, he said: "So now the model has precisely N parameters, where N is vocabulary size. We have one probability for each word, and all these probabilities must sum to 1. So strictly speaking, we actually have N-1 parameters."  I'm a bit confused about why we actually have N-1 parameters. Could someone explain it to me? Thanks!![1.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c2f27845-0a35-4c3f-949f-c197d22df3c0/1.png)when you know the probabilities for N-1 words, the probability for last word can be calculated by 1 minus the total probability for the first N-1 words. So the probability for last word would be known. thus there are N-1 pramaters. This is my understanding. In this model, there are N parameters and one constraint - sum of probability of all words is 1. You only need to determine N-1 parameters, and can calculate the Nth parameter. So the model and all parameters of it can be determined. In this case, we can say this model just have N-1 parameters. What others have answered is correct. You only need to find out N-1 probabilities. The Nth probability can be obtained by subtracting the sum of other probabilities from 1.
SciPy for MP3 The readme suggests to use SciPy in MP3 but it seems the autograder doesn't have the SciPy module. Is it supposed to be this way? I didn't use the SciPy and passed the MP3, matrix operation should be enough. Same here, I too didn't use Scipy and was able to complete MP3  It may be easy to use it, but numpy matrix operations are also helpful. Agree, NumPy is enough. I didnt use Scipy and passed the grader...
MP2.3 Question Hello,  I'm not familiar with python, the instruction asks us to modify score_one() function, but the code calls for  ranker.score(), is score() function overwritten by score_one() ? What's the logic befind? Thanks.Hello, I think modify score_one function is your first step. Then, you need to modify the load_ranker function to call your InL2Ranker Class and function. Step 1 is to implement the algorithm by modifying this function:  ``` def score_one(self, sd):         """         You need to override this function to return a score for a single term.         For fields available in the score_data sd object,         @see https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html         """         return (self.param + sd.doc_term_count) / (self.param * sd.doc_unique_terms + sd.doc_size) ```  Step 2 is to replace the current metapy.index.JelinekMercer() with 'InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0)' as identified in the python comment:  ``` def load_ranker(cfg_file):     """     Use this function to return the Ranker object to evaluate, e.g. return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0)      The parameter to this function, cfg_file, is the path to a     configuration file used to load the index. You can ignore this for MP2.     """     return metapy.index.JelinekMercer() ```  Hope this helps! I finished the assignment,  I just want to know why the program calls ranker.score() in main instead of ranker.score_one() ? It seems we call ranker.score() because score is an attribute of the ranker variable assigned when created using the metapy_index where score is a function defined under the ranker class (https://github.com/meta-toolkit/metapy/blob/master/src/metapy_index.cpp):  ``` #C++ of metapy     py::class_<index::ranker> rank_base{m_idx, "Ranker"};     rank_base         .def("score",              [](index::ranker& ranker, index::inverted_index& idx,                 const corpus::document& query, uint64_t num_results,                 const index::ranker::filter_function_type& filter) {                  return ranker.score(idx, query, num_results, filter);              },              "Scores the documents in the inverted index with respect to the "              "query using this ranker",              py::arg("idx"), py::arg("query"), py::arg("num_results") = 10,              py::arg("filter")              = std::function<bool(doc_id)>([](doc_id) { return true; }))         .def("score",              [](index::ranker& ranker, index::inverted_index& idx,                 std::unordered_map<std::string, double>& query,                 uint64_t num_results,                 const index::ranker::filter_function_type& filter) {                  return ranker.score(idx, query.begin(), query.end(),                                      num_results, filter); ________________________________________________________________ #Our Python use class InL2Ranker(metapy.index.RankingFunction):     """     Create a new ranking function in Python that can be used in MeTA.     """     def __init__(self, some_param=1.0):         self.param = some_param         # You *must* call the base class constructor here!         super(InL2Ranker, self).__init__()  def load_ranker(cfg_file):     """     Use this function to return the Ranker object to evaluate, e.g. return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0)      The parameter to this function, cfg_file, is the path to a     configuration file used to load the index. You can ignore this for MP2.     """     return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0)   ranker = load_ranker(cfg)  results = ranker.score(idx, query, top_k) ```  I wish I was a C/C++ wiz to provide a better answer but hope this helps!  My understanding is that class InL2Ranker is subclass of metapy.index.RankingFunction. The score_one( ) is override the super class'. And the score( ) is super class' function which calls score_one( ).

I am now seeing an internal error when trying to deliver the payload too. It looks like none of the submission history on livedatalab loads anymore either. I am also having the same issue, I tried everything on campuswire - still not working. Same issue here as well. I tried deleting and adding the webhook but no luck. I could ping/push now at a less rush time (6:30am CST). Looks like Livedatalab issue is resolved either by itself or some TAs.
Cant Import metapy Edit: Follow #28 would solve the problem even for windows10.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1b6e212e-176e-4b9b-ab32-768a8b279686/image.png)  **pip install metapy pytoml** seems only produce **Collecting metapy**.   I am trying to install metapy using windows cmd.It looks to me that **metapy** package is not correctly installed in your machine. Can you simply type *metapy* inside your python window and see if it returns you the path where your package is installed (Ideally, it should be inside Python 3.5.2 directory for you)?   Snapshot result would look something like this: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/0bfd5aa0-d3af-4315-8516-77bda411b53a/image.png) I tried, metapy is simply not installed. I gave up the windows cmd. I tried anaconda and followed the pinned instruction #28 and the instruction for mac also works for windows10. Even I was unable to get metapy to install correctly on my computer. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy works natively there. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153 Did you just copy paste the .py file into a new .pynb file? Yes I just copied it into a cell of the ipynb file
MP3 deadline Can someone confirm if the MP3 deadline has been extended to Oct 26? On coursera it still says Oct 23 (today). Thanks!Please refer #1067 Thank you! The deadline has been extended to Oct 26 Thanks!
I only see MP1 and MP2.3 on LiveDataLab? As the title says. I cannot find MP2.1 or MP2.2.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/15f3c2dd-fa7f-4c22-b7d3-7c78da0cd625/image.png)MP2.1 and 2.2 should be done outside LiveDataLab.

Is there a way to play the coursera video at a timestamp Hi,  While tagging the coursera videos, I was wondering if there is a way to have a URL which can play the video starting at the particular given timestamp, similar to youtube?   Does coursera support it?I think the suggested way would be to simply highlight the text from the transcript You can highlight the text from the video script and click on Save. You will be able to add notes and save notes at this point along with the video at that point in time. The next time when you click on see "all notes" you should be able to view them in the order you saved. And will also be able to play the video from that time stamp. Hope it helps.
Not sure whats wrong with the livedatalab I have pushed my code to GitHub; however, on livedatalab I just see this... I am really confused about what went wrong... I don't really know how to test my code either. I would really appreciate someone's help here. I have attached the screenshots below ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-26%20at%202.54.45%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e78f5bc1-d064-4ea9-bef8-400667fff9dc/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-26%20at%202.54.45%20PM.png)![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-26%20at%202.54.49%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/5d8e8ea1-c172-4e48-bb22-554ec254304e/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-26%20at%202.54.49%20PM.png)Have you set up the webhook for your github account and linked your github with on livedatalab? It seems the grader is not able to access your code. I did add the webhook in my github but it still says FAILURE Are you sure you have set up your github account with the right access token? Can you try relinking your github and then resubmitting? Do you see a checkmark similar to the screenshot for your webhook set-up?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e645201e-8d37-490e-86bd-92f5b296e0d0/image.png) yes, I do see the checkmark. It still says "FAILURE". Same message as seen in the screenshot in the original post. did you commit all files you changed in MP1 folder? example.py , config.toml, etc ? maybe it can't find one of the files? I made sure that everything was added correctly... I still can't figure this out. I made multiple attempts trying to relink the GitHub on the livedatalab and tried the webhook steps again... still... nothing works. It still seems like the grader cannot access your code. Are you sure you have used the correct PAT key when linking the github?  I got it to work. Just had to restart everything and regenerate a new PAT key. Thank you all! wait... do we need a config.toml to finish this MP? I did not use but the code still ran without error on my vscode. Hi im having this same issue. Did you press delete linked accounts and then add a new account on livedatalab?
livedatalab issue I am trying to submit my code in github.com (with code commit) but somehow it doesnot show any changes in livedatalab. So I regenerated github token and added it in. As I tried submitted again and it didn't work I deleted existing links and recreated the link. It still seems not working. And, I don't know if it will impact my MP1 submission (hope not). Any suggestion? Thanks.MP1 is already graded, and it would only use your highest grade so it won't be impacted. Is the problem solved? I have the same problem here It's resolved. To make sure, I also updated MP1 code and committed it. So it triggered the run in livedatalab again and it shows success in MP1.
MP2.3- Stuck at Running queries Hello all,   I am trying to run my code and it seems like it got stuck at 'ranker.score(idx, query, top_k)'.

Projects tab from LivedataLab  is missing HI, I am trying to access livedatalab from coursera, it does not show me "projects" (or any other tabs) to select MP1.  Not sure what is wrong in my setup. Please let me know how to fix this issue ?  I get an error indicating user already enrolled if I click on following link. I am not sure if  this is an issue.   http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/course/join/WZS77P00E570J74 I don't see project tab when I login to livedatalab.  ![Screenshot%20%2822%29.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4aac55a6-0b5e-4f47-a473-1ef09eb1b704/Screenshot%20%2822%29.png) Thanks.Since you are already enrolled, the above link will give you an "already enrolled" message. Can you try using this link and see if you see the projects in the menu choices (http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/)? Make sure you are logged in using your Illinois Id and see a Log out option on the top right corner when using the above link.  Also, sometimes deleting browser cookies or using another browser solves the problem when the page doesn't open correctly, worth giving a try.  Hope this helps. Thanks for the hints.   I expanded my browser window and now  I am able to see logout and all other navigation buttons (including projects) !  Hey Ayush, I am having the same problem here. After clicking the link you provided, here is my screen shot. Plus it appears my coursera account is not able to receive the auto grader result from livedatalab yet. Many thanks for the kind help.  ![A8FCFFF8-4BAF-4C55-B31D-C237FAFA09BC.jpeg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/36bf4d9e-9d98-415f-8337-4d02f60e2e74/A8FCFFF8-4BAF-4C55-B31D-C237FAFA09BC.jpeg) Can you please try resubmitting it after opening the Livdatalab page using Coursera 'Open Tool' option? If you directly opened the Livdatalab page and did the Git commit/push, it could be that your connection is not made to Coursera and that's why you don't see the grade there. More details are provided in #155. Hope this helps.
LM smoothing Hello, I am trying to understand the smoothing process of a LM.  First we have **(slide 1)**: ![3.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/618596b7-3fbb-45e4-82aa-751001c0c8ea/3.PNG) To smooth this LM we can do this **(slide 2)**: ![1.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e3d201f2-f496-43d9-98a5-4af4f757ff5d/1.PNG) As a result, we have the ranking function. And now we also need to smooth the P_seen(w|d) and for example below is using the JM smoothing **(slide 3)**: ![2.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/cf7a18de-60d7-48a9-9bdd-fead15574c32/2.PNG)  Questions:  1. Is the smoothing in slide 2 also JM smoothing? 2. What is "**Discounted**" ML estimate in slide 2? 3. Why there are two smoothing in this process? Why can't we just smooth only once? 4. How do we get this equation below: ![Capture.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c8ad47e4-c3ef-4cdf-b833-676fe09a4ea3/Capture.PNG)  I was revisiting the slides for the midterm exam and I found these really confused me. Please advise, thank you very much! (1) The smoothing in slide 2 is the general intuition/idea behind smoothing, not a specific smoothing method. This idea is used in both the smoothing methods that we discuss, where $$\alpha_{d}$$ is the smoothing parameter. In case of JM smoothing, the value of $$\alpha_{d}$$ will be $$\lambda$$. (2) It is called "Discounted" MLE, because we are not going to use the actual MLE, rather, we are going to deduct some amount from the MLE in order to give some weight to $$p(w|C)$$. (3) I did not understand this question - could you please clarify about where you see smoothing being done twice? (4) The numerator -  $$p_{seen}(w|d)$$, which is $$(1-\lambda)p_{ML}(w|d) + \lambda p(w|C)$$ (p_{ML}(w|d) is nothing but the maximum likelihood estimate). The denominator $$\alpha_{d}p(w|C)$$ for JM smoothing is $$\lambda p(w|C)$$ because $$\alpha_{d} = \lambda$$ for JM smoothing. Thank you so mush! Your answers clear all my confusion. For question (3) now I understand: only one smoothing has been done. What we are doing in slide 3 is just rewrite the P_seen(w|d).
can't have the exam on coursera hey i'v scheduled the exam using the link from the TA, and followed through the registration process, but when the proctor input the pass word on the "proctorU password" session, the page always responded by saying "0%" is correct, and then i can't proceed to get my exam started...Angela, I'm really sorry to hear that. The same thing happened to me this morning. Assma very kindly confirmed that ProctorU has been given the correct password for this exam. I suspect, based on my experience with ProctorU over the last five hours, that an incorrect copy of that password was loaded into ProctorU's customer service system, as only one person at ProctorU was able to get it working. David hey I managed to solve the issue - please ask for the help of Douglas.G - seems he is the guy can crack this issue. hey I hope you finished the exam ... it's really annoying. i actually think it's because when the password is correct, system didn't assign a valid number other than 0 to the credit/score, so the next page reject the validation as it's looking for the confirmation from the previous page. Seems like it worked for me so it might be them giving incorrect passwords. It's definitely an issue with the proctors either having a bad password or typing a good password incorrectly. I'd like to think that the "adventures" of this morning would inspire the ProctorU folks to figure this out. Although, for both me and Angela, Douglas G has been the only person who can get it working.  Thank you both very much. I just finished my exam and the initial password still wasn't fixed, but the fix was relatively easy since I knew what to ask. You saved me (and my proctor) so much time! I am facing the same issue for half an hour. My proctor is still struggling with this. I hope someone can help me... Just tell her/him to ask Douglas.G - that’s their coworker. I asked for his name in case other ppl need his help  Thanks,I did ask, but it is still not solved. I will ask the proctor again perhaps he is off the work? just a guess. Do the TAs recommend taking this exam on weekdays? Considering that the ProctorU folks have to reach out to others for potential issues. Just asking since this is the first time I am using this service and I am scheduled to take the test on Sunday. New slots for the weekend opened apparently! Checkout proctorU again  i have used procu service before, this is the first time i ran into an issue. I don't think there is a difference.
What should we do on LiveDataLab about MP 2.1 I see there is a project here on LiveDataLab about MP 2.1, I would like to confirm if we don't have to do anything about it there? Feeling strange because I saw 3 students started on that one.   I understand we just have to use the extension to collect 15 entries which can be checked on this website: http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000/.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d5bb4bc3-975b-427e-ac4c-980114d1d537/image.png)You are correct - there is no need to use LiveDataLab for MP2.1 or MP2.2. If you can see the 15 entries on the linked website, then you have completed MP2.1.

MP3 Clarifications I have some questions about this MP.  1. Do we have to deal with synonyms, stemming, capitalization, or stopword/punctuation removal in any way?  2. Should we sort the stored vocabulary alphabetically? Can we? I think I heard a TA say that we should do it, but I am not sure.  3. All logs should be base-2, right?  4. What does calculate_likelihood() do? Calculate $$\log{P(C|\Lambda)}$$? Does that equal $$\sum_{d \in C} \sum_{w \in V} (c(w,d) * \log{\sum_{j \in topics}}P(topic = j | doc = d) * P(word = w | topic = j))$$ and append it to self.likelihoods?  5. When should calculate_likelihood() be called? At the start of each iteration of the loop in plsa()? At the end of each iteration of that loop?  6. What is to be done with self.likelihoods? Do we stop when the amount by which it increases falls below some threshold (epsilon?), or is it just an output of our algorithm?  7. Are we supposed to do anything using the labels on the first 100 documents? Should they just be discarded?  8. expectation_step() computes self.topic_prob, correct? self.topic_prob[d, j, w] equals the probability that word w in document d is generated from topic j, right?  9. Are there really only 6 unique words and 2 topics in test.txt? Will there be more topics and words in the collection of documents we are getting evaluated on? The documents we were provided look very unnatural.   10. How is our code to be evaluated? Will you check self.document_topic_prob and  self.topic_word_prob? Will self.likelihoods be checked? Will runtimes be checked? How tight is the runtime limit?   Sorry for asking so many questions, but this assignment seems fairly complicated. Thank you for your help.Hi, in most cases the instructions in the code comments should be enough to guide your programming. For your questions: 1. No. 2. No. 3. The default one, "np.log", should be good.  4. Yes, you are required to follow this fomula.  5. At the end of each iteration. Follow E-M-Likelihood in each iteration.  6. Just append each likelihood to it. You can observe whether the algorithm converges by printing it. Epsilon is used to compare with the absolute difference of the continuous two likelihoods.  7. No, ignore them. 8. Yes. 9. In test.txt it is the case. You are required to calculate them instead of hard coding them. It is unnatural indeed.  10. It is to compare the results of your codes with the results of our codes. You should get all parts in the comments finished.   Hope this will help! Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions?  I am still a bit confused about how our code should be run.  Is this the correct structure for the loop in Corpus.plsa()?  ``` for iteration in range(max_iter):         # Do E-step         # Do M-step         # Compute log-likelihood and append it to the list ```  Do we always go through all "max_iter" iterations? Should I have something along the lines of:  ``` if (self.likelihoods[len(self.likelihoods) - 1] - self.likelihoods[len(self.likelihoods) - 2]) < epsilon:         break ```  Thank you!  Edit: Also, is it allowed to create a num_topics field within the Corpus class? This can be calculated on the fly from the size of document_topic_prob or topic_word_prob, but it would be convenient.  Edit: I had a num_topics field in the Corpus class, and added a condition to stop if the log-likelihoods decreased by less than epsilon. I also made the log-likelihoods start at negative infinity instead of zero. By doing this, my code passed the autograder. Yes, it's correct. The stop condition may be either 1) the abs diff < epsilon or 2) reach the max_iter. Thank you. Hi Yuxiang, I find that the printout of my vocabulary contains words like "\tchicago", "\n", "1\tseattle". We have to remove these characters right? The vocabulary size should be 6 after removing them, is that correct? Yes, you may consider to use .split() to remove "\t" and "\n".
Lesson 4.5 Equation Question Hi, can someone please clarify what the value of n represents in the equation? My interpretation was that it represented the # of terms that were in both the doc and the query. ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-26%20at%205.54.19%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/37e49eb1-f91f-4adb-b6c5-82cc2fab162e/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-26%20at%205.54.19%20PM.png)I remember n = |Q|, query length  Got it, thank you!
Exam1 Hi, What's the time frame that we can take the exam? Is it Oct16-Oct22? Is it Oct10-Oct16?https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/717 some one said here we should pause until the TAs release more information. Oct 10th - 16th I guess it is the 10th -16th. You can refer to the official page. Oct 10th - 16th. You have to sign up for a time through ProctorU
Facing LiveDataLab issue - Submission not RUNNING Hi TAs,  I forgot my password for the livedatalab and I registered again. After following the github linking and course registration, I submitted the assignment without implementation ( just the skeleton code) to check the integration and I am seeing FAILURE.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f4172ae6-451f-48e6-98ef-4526cf0816bd/image.png)If you go to your repository > settings > webhooks > click on webhook, do you see something like this? I am wondering if the deliveries and being successful (green checkmark)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/299611c2-7528-48fd-bf20-03b55f2a04f9/image.png) Yes. The delivery status is OK 200.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1a182ac1-1107-4a54-91a7-b643677bc27f/image.png) Seem like livedatalab is not able to pull your code. This could be because your entered github username and API key are incorrect. Can you try relinking your github account?  Thank you. The API Key was wrong.
Build success! but Score is 0 ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4690bbe8-c79b-4ee4-a041-feda0db2c8ae/image.png)  However from the leader board, the score is 0. Why is that?I believe this means you did not write the code correctly, make sure you define tok and trigrams and use the instructions to tokenized, lowercase, length filter and stemming step by step I went through the exact requirement in the MP1 and realized I did some steps not exactly what it is asking. So that's why I get a score of 0. Now, I have fixed that and got 1. Thanks everyone!
Exam registration Now that there is a week left till the beginning of the exam period, I am still confused on the registration process. I heard some people who have registered, but have seen other comments to wait for formal instructions from a TA. In the past I've seen TAs email links to students to specifically register for exams. I'm seeing conflicting information. Are we supposed to self register or are the TAs in the process of sending out formal instructions?Please go ahead and register yourself. I know many did. While in ProctorU, please select CS 410 - DSO - Exam 1 -  Fall22. Cost is $16 I believe we are still in the process of sending out the formal instructions. I will let you know when the instructor provides me more information. Please wait for official information to be released before registering or paying any fees. An update: You should receive official information tonight or tomorrow. If you have already registered, I think it should be fine. But the official information is yet to be sent out. Ok thank you for the information. I shall wait then Please take a look at the pinned post #805

Also, are you using Chrome and have you installed the ProctorU extension?  ￼I open the camera and microphone,then refresh the website, but nothing happened  try incognito mode .. if it doesnt work ,you need to provide access to microphoen and camera Make sure you have the proctorU chrome plug in installed. Also, make sure you are logged into your UIUC google acount
document topic probability converging to 50% I don't really want to post my code so I'm hoping someone ran into this. I thought I was understanding the e and  m steps but after finishing those I printed out my document topic prob matrix to compare against some of the first couple rows since those have know topics.  All of my topic probabilities slowly converge to 50% for each topic on all documents. Clearly I missed something.I believe this is happening because I was trying to use the normalize function provided in the e step and ended up normalizing across vocab instead of topic. How do I create my own normalize? My attempts failed so far.
Submission failed with no logs I pushed my code and these are the results I see so Im not sure why my code is failing. Its looked like this for over an hour. I put my p value in significance.txt and made the appropriate changes in score_one() and load_ranker(). What could be the issue?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6a02776b-4dbc-430a-b1eb-7af027b4c500/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e4a1a08e-7dbb-4c69-b596-358609734236/image.png)I had the same problem before. I followed the first answer in #560 and solved the issue. Just delete the linked account in LiveDataLab, go to github to generate a new personal token, go back to LiveDataLab to link the new account again, then git push again.
Campuswire Class Code I have a friend who joined late trying to get access to this class campuswire, is there a join code anywhere?I think they have to reach out to the TA or the Professor to have them added. There isn't a specific code to join the group When I wasn't added to a particular course in Campuswire, reaching out to MCS Support also helped me. But a TA added me in that case, so Syed's answer may be a shortcut Yup, I got course access late and promptly got campuswire access after emailing TA haritar2@illinois.edu Please ask your friend to email me (czhai@illinois.edu) and I'll add him/her to Campuswire.

a higher gMAP and a higher MAP  If X has a higher gMAP, can X also have a higher MAP? Or a higher MAP and also a higher gMAP?Depends on the input values (query scores). gMAP is more affected by small values than MAP. Try making up a few sets of input values, then calculate (in a spreadsheet, for example) the values of MAP and gMAP for each. gMAP and MAP are not related to each other, meaning, a list with a higher MAP can be with higher or lower gMAP. The averages are only the properties of the numbers involved and their distribution.
Project Proposal Reviews Now Available Hi everyone,  I've just made the submitted reviews available to each respective group. Thank you to those who have submitted their reviews on time. For the others, please try to submit them as soon as possible, as your comments will provide students with valuable feedback on their proposals.   In addition, the meta-reviews + grades are being entered into Coursera by the course staff. Not all proposals have been graded yet / have meta-reviews, but I'll send an update once everything has been completed.  The next deadline is the progress report, due Nov 14th. For the peer review after this deadline, you'll simply use the same peer review form, but answer the questions marked [PROGRESS]. The progress report is graded based off of completion, asking that your group clearly addresses the following points: 1) Progress made thus far, 2) Remaining tasks 3) Any challenges/issues being faced.  Thanks! -Kevin  
Additional Issues with MP1 grades on Coursera Hello,  I have been able to submit my lab on LiveDataLab and verify the submission and leaderboard, but the connection to Coursera isn't working. I have clicked on the OpenTool button on the MP1 page on Coursera and resubmitted following the advice on #155 and #249, but that hasn't worked. What else should I try?hi!  I just checked your leaderboard score and updated your Coursera MP1 grade manually. Hopefully this issue doesn't persist for future MPs
MP1_Pre-trained POS-tagger model  Hi Guys, in the README file in the assignment 1, it mentioned we have to download the pre-trained POS-tagger model to see certain demonstrations.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a88ad7c3-6e13-4400-8e13-c262df73fbd3/image.png)   I have downloaded the file, but not sure how to incorporate the file into the code?   tagger = metapy.sequence.PerceptronTagger("perceptron-tagger/")  This code is causing some confusion .. appreciate the help in advance I am assuming you got some kind of error message. When you run the code, it should download greedy-perceptron-tagger.tar.gz to your current directory and unzip the file there. If not, you can always do it manually. You just need to make sure the perceptron-tagger folder is in the same location as your script.  ![Capture.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/798873c2-fcff-4a8f-bf48-6f1c72401e48/Capture.PNG) You need to download the zip file and unzip it to your python working directory first. To find out where your working directory is, you can do the following:  ``` import os os.getcwd() ```
Week 1 Practice Quiz - Pull vs Push About the question from week 1 practice quiz:  Select the following applications that provide push information access.  I selected Bing, because when I go to bing.com, I see a search bar on the page, but below that I see a list of popular articles, top stories in my location, weather, local traffic, etc.  My answer was marked incorrect.  Wouldn't those items be considered recommendations based on my location and interests? Why would this not be considered push information access?  Thank you!I also had the same question when I was doing the quiz. They way I understand those Bing "pushes" is that they are more like **trending stroies and news** targeting all the users in the network (maybe your nearby network or the whole internet) but are not necessarily based on your personal interests. In other words, those breaking news and wehther information are usually considered interesting for alomost all the users. Thank you for the comment.  Here's an article describing how bing.com pushes results based on your personal interests. This is probably gathered from your browsing history and previous searches.  https://www.searchenginejournal.com/bing-introduces-personalized-image-video-feeds/204156/  I'd like to hear from one of the TAs on whether this is considered pull or push, and whether the quiz should be updated based on this information. ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-24%20at%2010.24.44%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/fd42bdee-e823-4e83-a088-498d80f31338/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-24%20at%2010.24.44%20AM.png) The way I understand it is how we look at Bing and Google as a general search engine tool. They belong to the search engine category therefore the main purpose of them is to provide result based on users input. Recommendation articles and push system are just their side-features, but the main purpose is user init. search queries and it belongs to pull mode. Hope this helps.  Thank you, that information really helps. I think when they mention Bing, they only consider its searching engine part. In general how are we supposed to infer meaning from questions like this?  In general how are we supposed to infer meaning from imprecise questions like this? Thank you To be honest, I will also chose the "wrong" answer in this case. It has to be answered by TAs. When the lectures and textbook talk about Google and Bing, they're always referring to the classic user query search engine functionality, i.e. pull mode, so I suppose that we're supposed to answer these questions in the context of the course material. It is definitely confusing given the wide range of services these companies provide today, though, I agree. I see the point of the intention of this question, but i would prefer a question with answer less debatable. not like I don't understand bing.com is a search engine, but I feel frustrated that I go one step further to check on actual application, and see they are opening recommendation window and trying to get as accurate as possible then instead losing my score :-( Hi Rick,  I had the same thought and selected all the four options since there appeared to be some ambiguity in terms of what we intend to go on the bing or google maps i.e. do we want to just search for a particular address?   However, if you give it a thought again, and try to correlate this question with respect to the concept being taught. The two options are essentially search engines and not recommendation systems. Even when we type in a particular type of food they will generate a list of options available near by but won't recommend this based on your preferences from the past where as the recommendation system stores some of your previous choices in order to push you the information.  To summarize, it goes back to the basic Who takes the initiative? 1. User - Then its pull (in case of maps the user takes the initiatives and not the system) 2. System - then it is push  I hope this helps.

CS 410 DL - code Hi,  I was wondering if we can access the implementation of this search engine. It will be a good learning and exploring the concepts learned so far and in the future. Thank you for your interest in CS410 DL! Most of the search functionality itself actually uses [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch), an open-source search engine based on Lucene. The code itself doesn't actually implement a search engine, rather it communicates with a cluster of Elastic nodes. So, if you're interested in learning more, I'd recommend that you check out Elasticsearch! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
tech review score weight for 4-credit students I was wondering how much percentage is the tech review counted towards the total score? Thanks!I think it's just for completion where you need to have completed the tech review to pass the course, but it doesn't contribute to the final grade formula. Thanks!  Hi Qinjingwen, According to information in Week 1, tech review doesn't have a score weight. But not sure if TA will include them as the information in Week 1 is general for 3 and 4-credit students  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/1gMIe/syllabus
Does it make sense to use a complex Language Model instead of the Unigram LM? This question is mainly out of curiosity but directly related to Week 4.  One of the things that surprised me about the **Unigram LM** is that we don't give importance to the order of the words in the query. Basically, $$\text{p("Today is Friday")} = \text{p("Today Friday is")}$$. From the lectures, I understand that although this assumption isn't true, it is necessary to simplify the model. However, that would mean that documents with many key terms in any order would probably rank higher than real content documents, assuming they don't get too penalized by their length. - If this is true, how do search engines overcome this? - Is the simplification necessary to improve computation?   - Would it make sense to use something like **GPT-3** to replace **Unigram Query Likelihood**?  ThanksGoogle makes a pretty good case that a generalized n-gram model would be sufficient. See https://books.google.com/ngrams/. Based on the limitation that the n-gram need to show up in 40 books, they probably have a decent heuristic for how large to make n for this case. IMHO the more gram you used the more accurate the model is, at cost of computation resources; The large language model, on the other hand, revealed the relationship and similarity of the words at a very high dimensional space thus more accurate. This is an excellent question. The lack of consideration of order of words in the "bag of words" representation is a well known limitation of this kind of representation. As already pointed out in the following posts earlier, using n-grams is generally more accurate than using just unigrams. However, unigrams are often working reasonably well, especially with the use of the proximity heuristic, which prefers matching the query words in a small window of text. A main reason is when we match two words, X and Y, it's not so common that both "X Y" and "Y X", as a phrase, would make sense. That is, the order tends to be the "right" order that we need. For example, if X="stock", Y="price", then once we know we match both words, it's most likely that the matching content is about the "price of stock" or "stock price", making it unnecessarily to explicitly rank "stock price" on top of "price stock". If we use n-grams (e.g., "stock price" as a single term), it wouldn't (automatically) match a single word like "stock" or "price". This means if a document says "price of stock", it wouldn't match the phrase. If we use both "stock price" and "price" as indexing terms, it would also cause complication in assigning weights because we might over-reward matching the phrase "stock price" since it would not only match the phrase term "stock price" but also two single words "stock" and "price". However your idea of using GPT-3 to improve query likelihood is a great idea!  I encourage you to try it in MP2.4 or MP4 (which will be about neural ranking models). 
W2: what is uniform code? Hi, I am confused about the uniform code (week 2). Could anyone explain what the "uniform code" is? Thanks!  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/bb3148dd-f4cd-4548-a1bd-e8ff70a7d3bc/image.png)For the Gamma code, as highlighted, you can read it as "binary code" Uniform code is equal length coding or binary coding. (The first bullet shown on the slide) Uniform code is just binary coding Uniform code is just another name for Binary Code. 
Practice Q9 measures affected by document length Hi folks, I wonder why the correct answer to Q9 is "L2 distance"? Isn't cosine similarity also calculated by the same vector? My explanation is that the value of L2 distance normally increases as the document size increases; is this correct?  Thanks!This helped me: https://www.baeldung.com/cs/euclidean-distance-vs-cosine-similarity With cosine similarity, you divide out the magnitudes (see #4).  This link is also a good reference for this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19410270/vector-space-model-cosine-similarity-vs-euclidean-distance If calculating similarity using the normalized vectors, Euclidean distance and cosine similarity should yield the same result. If not normalized by length, then cosine deals with the length effect. It's easier to remember the difference by thinking about it this way: cosine looks at the angle while Euclidian looks at the distance.  The link provided below has a good solution to your answer  https://cmry.github.io/notes/euclidean-v-cosine
number_of_topics how do we obtain number of topics for E-step, since the function doesn't give it as a argument like M-step did?You can get if from the shape of the document_topic_prob You can either store it as a class variable in the plsa function or extract from the shape of the document to topic probability matrix which u r using in the calculation. I changed the function signature.
Rank vs. Overall Score Hi, It looks like there are occasions where a submission receives a higher overall score but is ranked lower on the leaderboard: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/77335636-f4b2-46d4-9385-24bf97d04898/image.png) Seems like that rank is currently based on the first score (NDCG@10 on APNews).I think the first score column is our total score. This one is the score you earn on the faculty dataset.  --This was wrong! The last column is our final score. Thank you for answering. I thought about that too, but it looks like that the numbers don't go together with the formula "Overall Score" = 0.1* NDCG@10 on APNews + 0.3* NDCG@10 on Cranfield + 0.6* NDCG@10 on Faculty dataset. TAs just updated the livedatalab. I was wrong! The last column is the final score!
Lesson 5.7 I was looking back at week 5 lectures and have a doubt with the 'Equilibrium equation'. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/7b4c8437-94c4-4bba-b46b-39b08ac0c362/image.png)  This is the formula to predict the probability that we would find page j at time t+1.   1. Doesn't the second term actually sum to '1/N'? The sum of all probabilities of finding any page from i=1 to N at time t is 1. The second term comes to be alpha times 1/N. Thus, the following formula where we remove time index will be much simpler. Is it not done only because it is easy to solve the equation by using the eigen pattern or is there some other non-mathematical reason? 2. When we say both terms loop i from 1 to N, implicitly it means we include i=j also. Which means, we are taking into account the case where a jump from page j leads to page j itself. Is it ok to consider this in the second term (random jump)? And, what meaning or use case does it solve in the real world? Isn't the primary purpose to cover unlinked pages?Below is my understanding but please let me know your thoughts.  1. Yes, the term sums to 1/N, and it makes sense. Because the probability of reaching a specific page through random jumping should be the same, since we have N page, the prob. of reaching one specific page should be 1/N.  Assume alpha = 1, it means we assume a page can only be reached via random jumping.   -  P<t+1>(dj) = prob. of at page dj at time t+1 - 1/N = prob. of jumping to page j (from page i) - P<t>(dj) = prob. of at page dj at time t  2. Since it is a random jump, it is possible the jump to a same page. The random jump will cover unlinked pages, but it does not necessarily mean we should exclude all linked pages (including a page itself) from the consideration set. I was thinking the exact same thing about the 2nd term, but would be interested to hear from an instructor. Conceptually, I thought of it as:  (alpha = the probability of choosing to jump to a random page) * (the probability of randomly jumping to dj = 1/N)  , if there are N nodes in the graph
MP 2.2 and MP2.3 Hi,  When will the descriptions for MP2.2 and MP2.3 get uploaded?  Currently for 2.2, when I searched using any query, there was no "Relevant" or "Not Relevant" button like what is shown in the screenshot on Coursera for MP2.2.  Thanks,  I am also waiting for the update.   > the UI will be updated mid-morning on 9/12  Let's wait for a moment. To see the update, you need to redownload the extension. The TA just post it. Hope it helps!

Group Project: misinformation Hi,   I'm looking for teammates that are interested in developing a tool for misinformation identification or related topic- I'm personally interested in this topic. I have some background in social media and audience research as a data scientist. I live in U.S (EDT) and would prefer people with similar schedule (nights/weekends).   thanks~Jianci, identifying misinformation is a very interesting topic for me as well, and was among my reasons for applying to this program. I am in the Central time zone, so I'm sure we could find times to meet.  good - 1 hr difference won't be a problem. i will wait a little bit longer to see if we can get one or two more names on. then let's have a meeting to see how our skillset and expectations aligned regarding to this project. Jianci, shall I post an invitation for additional team members in the #project-team-search chat room that was created today? I would have done so already, but I did not want to claim we started a team to focus on misinformation without your agreement. thanks & pls go ahead :)
Be: Aux or Verb As for POS tagging, I understand that "be" in "I am studying" is Aux.  Which is "be" in "I am a student," Verb or Aux?I think "to be" in this case is a verb.  Forms of "to be" are auxiliary verbs when they're followed by a gerund (verb + -ing) to help make a progressive verb tense.  Hello Yutaro, "am" (or "be" if stemming is used) is a verb, as Brian mentioned. It could be marked as VERB or VBP (verb present tense), depending on which POS system is used. With a sentence like "Our team was asking some questions", "was asking" could be marked as AUX VERB or VBD (verb past tense) VBG (verb gerund). With a sentence like "We should be asking some questions", "should be asking" could be marked as MD (modal) VB (verb) VBG (verb gerund).  I hope this helps. Thank you so much! Thank you so much! Super helpful.
Grading Percentage of Tech Review Hello  May I know what is the grading percentage of Tech Review as I cannot find any information in Syllabus ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/16ee3870-cda3-4946-8a2e-54dea39b4e27/image.png) Looks like it is just a 'completed' thing. It does not contribute to the final grade. Can TA please confirm this. From the course introduction video: > As I said, the technology review is not actually contributing to you grade, but it's a metric component and it will be graded based on completion.  I'm having trouble finding it, but I thought I remember either the syllabus or a lecture video saying that noncompletion of the technology review reduces our overall final grade by a percentage amount? Would need a TA to confirm. Short of a TA confirming, here is the grade page for the final project which does not include a percentage. It is simply for completion  ![Screenshot%20%28391%29.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/101295c4-d84a-4365-b1f0-20d2c566ca4c/Screenshot%20%28391%29.png) Since tech review is only for students enrolling with 4 credit hours, the above is for 3-credit and the above + tech review is for 4-credit. The tentative percentages for the above : tech review is 90% :10%.  What does 90% : 10% mean? I think it means:  above all : tech review = 90 : 10 What does "above all : tech review = 90 : 10" mean? Tentative grading percentage will be adjusted to satisfy  > (Quiz + MP + Project + Exams) : Tech Review = 90 : 10 Okay, thank you.
grading problem I received the full grade at livedatalab on Sep. 24th  but the Coursera shows unsumbitted.

Confused on Inl2 ranker function I believe I have everything implemented properly for the Inl2 function, but the one thing I'm confused on is the summation part of the formula. I understand that we are taking the sum of all the terms in the query that appear in the document, but confused on what to actually iterate over. I was thinking of using a loop to create a cumulative sum of the scores, but couldn't find documentation on how to iterate to the next term with the sd object. Ultimately I don't really know what the sd object is and how to use it to implement the summation part of the formula. Any guidance would be appreciated ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9dece4ae-07cb-4133-8d95-d3f50ada388b/image.png)From https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.3:  "As you can see, the sd variable contains all the information you need to write the scoring function. The function you’re writing represents one term in the large InL2 sum."  In other words, you don't have to implement the summation itself, that's taken care of for you...you only need to define the general form for each term. You just need to write one term, without considering the summation. See the instruction below: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/13d873c8-adc1-4145-b35f-d6dd70db1015/image.png)  The instruction also has a link for the data structure of sd Ahhh I see I guess I read too quick and missed that part thank you!

Output as below:  Usage: /Users/yiboli/opt/anaconda3/envs/python=3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py config.toml An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.  SystemExit: 1I had to use python 3.5, not sure if that is your problem Did your program correctly locate your config.toml file? Hello Yibo, I can confirm that MP2.3 works with Python 3.7. Instead of Jupyter, please try executing from a command line 'python search_eval._text.py config.toml' and see if your problem goes away. For this to work, search_eval_test.py and config.toml should be in the same directory where you issue the command. David try to use terminal or commend line to run the code instead of using run button. It was samething for me in both Jupyter and VS code. I used command line to execute 'python search_eval._text.py config.toml' and it worked.  This works. although I have to downgrade to Python 3.5 otherwise it will run indefinitely. Thank you so much! Thank you very much! this works! you are right! thank you!!!
MP1 Due Date Can MP1 be turned in by Sept. 11 11:59 pm or is it before Sept. 11 completely (so by Sept. 10 11:59 pm)? From the TA's post 6 days ago, it looks like there is no late penalty for MP1, Quiz1 and 2. In general, all the deadlines are in Central time. For instance, MP2.1 is due Sep 11th at 11:59 PM CDT On the github page for the MP its saying "Due Sept 4, 2022: For students who just added the class, NO LATE PENALTY will be applied to submissions before Sept 11", is this just not updated correctly then? Can refer to post https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/310 Sorry for the confusion. The information there (on github) is probably out of date; we later decided to extend the deadline for everyone to Sept 11. 
project group Hello i am a first year mcs student from korea and if anyone is looking for a group for the final project. please email me at hyunjun5@illinois.eduLooks like someone (TA?) just added everyone to a chat room called "project-team-search" - might be helpful to post in there!
MP2.1 sign-on sheet Hello,  I am trying to access the MP2.1 sign-on sheet with my Illinois email address, but failed. Is anyone able to access this sheet now?We are still working on revising MP2.1, which is expected to be released on Monday, Sept 5. So please wait until then to work on it. The new version of MP2.1 will NOT require you to use the sign-on sheet. Sorry for the confusion.   Thank you, professor!
Releases of future MPs (2,3,4) Is it possible to release future MPs earlier? For online MCS students who are not doing this program full-time, sometimes we don't have time to do lectures, quizs and MPs (especially only released during that specific week) all in one week because of work, business travels etc.   It would be even better to have the leniency to submit all quizes and MPs before the hard deadline (week 7 and 13) without penalities. We've had that structure in CS437 Internet of things and it worked out great. Thanks for the suggestions. Having the course tasks and deadlines spread over the semester discourages students from procrastinating and reduces the chance that a student would be overwhelmed with too many tasks at the end of the semester, but I see that our online MCS students are in a very different situation than our on-campus students, thus we will make an exception to accommodate the special needs of all the students in the DSO section of the class. Specifically, we will allow the students in the DSO section to submit all quizes before the hard deadline (week 7 and 13) without penalty. For MPs, we will release MP2 and MP3 very soon (MP4 will be released a bit later).  However, we are constrained by the dependency among some of the MPs (i.e., one MP may depend on the completion of a previous one by all/most students in the class) and the need for synchronization in a leaderboard-based competition, thus it is infeasible for us to implement a general lenient policy for MPs as we could do for the quizzes. However,  we will be lenient in granting extensions of MP deadlines to all the students in the class.  We will do our best to approve any reasonable request for extension of a deadline and will generally approve the extension if it was due to a factor out of the student's control or an unexpected challenge encountered in finishing an MP (e.g., a problem with computing resources or a "mysterious" bug that couldn't be located exactly). Hope these will help everyone learn all the materials in the class without being stressed out. 
Confusion: CoLab with MP2.3 On MP2.3, I have a 0.7 on LiveDataLab, but when I try to work in CoLab, I get:  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'metapy.metapy.index.PivotedLength'  or  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'pybind11_type'  For the part in InL2Ranker where I add tfn to self.param.  Has anyone had this problem? How do you solve it? I don't know how I can complete the second part of the lab without it, because the first part will work in the grader but not on CoLab, and the Scipy stuff won't work in the grader.Hi Rachel,  You can use the online IDE to calculate the p-value. All you need to do is the prepare two lists of average precision, one from new rank function and one from BM25. Follow the photo I shown to calculate the p-value of two lists and save the p-value into significance.txt.  The hard part is that you might need to manually key in the data into list as Online IDE might not support read file from local desktop.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8c610a64-bd6c-406b-a6e6-c76ffab6bc5a/image.png)  https://replit.com/languages/python3 I'm not sure how I would make the lists though, since I'm having trouble getting the code itself to run outside of LiveDataLab. Sometimes it seems to work, but when I paste the code that seems to work on CoLab into my stuff to push to GitHub, it fails on LiveDataLab. So I'm not sure if the values I'm getting are correct.  Do you know if 0.2504 for PivotedLength() and 0.2551 for BM25 seem like normal MAP values? Or values like 0.2057? May be it's happening due to version difference between Colab and grader. I tried with Python 3.6 in my local and it worked fine in grader as well. Try upgrading the package in Colab and restarting the runtime after install. My MAP for Inl2 is 0.22779....     MAP for BM25 is 0.2551186  check post# 654 for your reference  
No Late Penalty for MP1, Quiz 1, Quiz 2 Hi all, Due to the high volume of extension requests for students just joining the class, we will be **removing any late penalty from MP1, Quiz 1, and Quiz 2.** This means that you can submit these items late and still get full credit/grade. This applies to **ALL** students. You no longer need to post on Campuswire to ask for an extension. Best of luck! 
quiz 1 due date Hi,  I wonder when is the due date for quiz 1? and how many tries we have for quiz 1?  thanks!!Looks like due date for quiz1 is 28th Aug . There are max 2 tries for the quizzes thanks!
Grouping between 3 and 4 credit students? Since the maximum group size is 3 people, can we form a group of 2 undergrad students and 1 grad student? Assuming the project expectation is the same, that is.Sure, you can have a mix of undergraduate and graduate students. A group of 4 or 5 is alright, too.
How to calculate syntactic structures for a sentence Why there are 2 syntactic structures ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8f02224f-0522-4aa4-bc39-34f3c06964f9/image.png)My understanding is “with a telescope” can be a man or a boy. Therefore, there are 2 syntactic structures. Syntactic structures are the many ways we can interpret the meaning of a sentence.  In this case, this sentence can be interpreted in two ways, which is what introduces ambiguity:  1. A man, saw a boy with (or holding) a telescope 2. A man (using a telescope) saw a boy  Both sentences carry different implications. The number of syntactic structures is how many ways a sentences can be interpreted. Yes , Syntactic is about structure of the sentence. The question is really about how many interpretation of the sentence you see here which is possible. And if you look at the sentence - there can be two  - "Whether man is having the telescope" OR "Boy is having the telescope". technically called - ambiguous prepositional phrase (PP Attachment) The distinction comes from the ambiguity whether we attach "with a telescope" to the man or the boy. A man saw a boy - with a telescope, A man saw - a boy with a telescope 
Content for Tech Review Hi, I am a little confused as I didn't find instructions regarding what to cover in a tech review (I am new to this so I am not familiar with the common structure). Is there anywhere I can find related information? Thanks very much!You should be able to choose a topic from this list:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yeKm8hJbyRGhiUDvZv9-S3Zzu5hDtET-O6Yeci-VPOs/edit#gid=0  And sign-up for your topic on this list:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hWAyxd82FcitN9eG3yMW6ckq6l1VASBtYWpaPbywMPc/edit#gid=0  :) Oh thank you Joel, that's very helpful. Actually what I am unsure about is more like how should I review something, i.e. what aspects to cover, how to arrange the structure of the review, etc. Oh, haha... Apologies.  It seems very open as the only requirements are:  "The review must have a coherent storyline (Intro, Body, Conclusion) and cite relevant references. It must be at least ~2 pages"  Edit:  This is identified in Week 8 on Coursera  Edit2:  The syllabus mentions:  "Tech Review (for 4-credit students). It will require you to generate a short 1-2 page review on an interesting course-related cutting-edge technology topic not covered in any lecture." That's good to know, haha, thank you! There is no hard structure requirement beyond the general coherent storyline (intro, body, conclusion). You are free to structure it however you would like.  You can think of it as a "mini-survey" on your chosen topic, where the goal is to teach others about your topic while positioning it within the related work.   Hope this helps! Hi Angela,  Think of Tech Review as writing a blog article on a topic. You can refer to medium.com, and towardsdatascience.com and look at how they pick up a topic and explain the concepts to readers.  That's a good point, thanks Parth!
Office Hours Are Yuxiang Liu's office hours ending next week? MP3 is due next week, but there do not seem to be many office hours available.You can find the OH information under Live Events. But yes, I also felt that there are not many office hours available. you can check the office hours under "live events" in coursera. it seems like we only have one TA office hours before the deadline next week.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e41f0052-c927-4ba2-a3af-c45ca845fa0a/image.png)
MP2.2 Grade Hi, I have complete MP2.2 last week but it is currently showing overdue. Any idea when it will be graded?Hi, I see the same, last time for MP2.1 the TA's were able to grade it right away. We will probably hear back soon on that coursera indicates it as overdue as no submission was received before the deadline. it's normal and you'll see your score after the TA team updates it in coursera. it's the same as MP2.1. Hi, thank you all for your patience. I've just uploaded the grades for MP2.2. Please let me know if you can't see it.  I can see the grade for MP2.2 now in Coursera. I can see the MP2.2 grade now. 
MP2.3 Confusion Despite the extension on this assignment and navigating through various forum posts, I cannot seem to get a general starting point for this assignment. The README syntax is very confusing to read through and does not inspire any ideas on direction. This could be why there are so many questions regarding the objective of the assignment.   We are asked to "Write an InL2 function". Do we actually need to write a function "InL2", or are we merely editing functions within the class InL2Ranker? There are many objectives given in the assignment without much foundational instruction. Perhaps a TA or student who has completed the assignment could provide some clarification.  You need to edit the function score_one within the InL2Ranker class. Below are the instructions/comment from the code under that function: "You need to override this function to return a score for a single term." So in editing this function, the intent is to return the formula displayed in the picture. But afterwards there is confusing instruction on how to send data to files and then perform analysis on said data. I am assuming we will need to iteratively send data to the files? And then perform the analysis using R?   Thank you for your assistance you can modify the output portion of the main function to only output the avg values, one per line, then put that output into a text file using   ``` search_eval.py config.toml > something.txt ```  repeat for both algorithms, then you can read in the files in python using numpy, and pass the two constructed numpy arrays into the given python code to get your answer. it'll be in a string format, so you have to copy over just the number to your significance.txt You basically have to update the score_one function to return the formula for InL2 in the Read Me file as python code. Use this link to find the fields you need for the formula: https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html Since you are passing in an sd object to the function, the fields you use for the formula should be written as "sd.field". So for example, sd.num_docs.  I feel like the second part gives a little bit more freedom in how to get it done. Basically when you run this file, it should give you a list of 225 values that you need to save in a text file. You need to do this part twice. First run the code using the BM25 ranker function. Do this by having the load_ranker function return that specific ranker method. Save the avg_p values only into a text file. Then repeat this again but for the InL2 ranker function (so have the load_ranker function return that ranker). What I found easier for me was to modify the code slightly to have two arrays that have all the avg_p values, one for BM25 and the other for InL2. Then I used these arrays with this python function to get the p-value: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html   You can save the p-value in a text file. I did this part manually and uploaded the text file to github. That seemed to do the trick for me. Hope this helps!
MP2.4 scores a 1 on LiveDataLab, but 0% in Coursera On my initial submission, I did not meet the baseline and my score in Coursera changed from not submitted to graded with a 0%. After subsequent tuning and exceeding the baseline for many runs now, my Coursera score is still 0%. Is this a problem on my end, or are the scores going to be updated manually after the due date like the previous few MPs?Same here. Waiting for TAs to confirm.  Similar post at #601 .  Same here as well. same here same here In case it helps - launching MP2.4 from Coursera again then adding a dummy commit did it for me. Thanks, that worked for me as well! Thank you, it works! Thanks @Sydney. It worked for me as well. Thanks @Sydney. It worked for me. Thanks very helpful I am having the same issue. Relaunching did not do the trick for me. Requesting TA's to look into it.  Thanks
Timeout on livedatalab I previously used three nested for loop to compute E-STEP and M-STEP, but I got the timeout error in livedatalab. Then I changed to two nested for loop, and I still get timeout error. Does anyone have any idea? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ba7bdac3-7dcd-4e1c-a8d1-e4a88c90df09/image.png)may want to double check your code. My code converged at 25 iteration. Based on the screen shot, it looks like the line "max_iterations = 50" in main () has been removed or commented out, causing your timeout. There is a single (not nested) for loop in plsa() that uses this variable. This is different from any for loops in the E-step or M-step functions. Thank you for the reply. I just check my code. the "max_iterations = 50" has not been removed or commented out. Should the program only runs 50 iterations in livedatalab? Thank you for the reply. Should I find the maximum likelihood in the for loop of plsa() after 50 iterations, or should I stop in the middle of the iterations? It seems that main() in LiveDataLab does not have the same limit. This suggests that your likelihood is not converging, as Xinlei hinted. You may wish to check the value of likelihood at the end of each iteration by printing it. If I understand correctly, the iteration will stop when the likelihood converges, is that correct? Do your model converge with the `test.txt` data? It should stop in the middle of iterations. Of course, `max_iteration` cannot be too small. You can try to set it to 500 for `test.txt` to see whether it converges. Oh I think I miss something in the iteration. It does not have and threshold to stop. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/2f00e1d3-d1f4-4b32-9c76-70927e675091/image.png) here u go May I ask what is the threshold? I do not see any comment in the script saying about the threshold, but there is an epsilon. Should I use the previous iteration's likelihood minus the current iteration likelihood to check if it is less than epsilon?. If it is, we should stop? I believe the intent is that iteration can stop when the most recent likelihood minus the previous likelihood is less than a particular value (which is given in the starter code). Please set the max_iter as 50 and add convergence check in your iterations. Either that you reach 50 iterations or that you satisfy the convergence condition will make your program stop. Usually it will converge in 50 iterations. Otherwise, you may need to check your codes. Yes
Project Proposal Format For the project proposal, does it need to be in essay format? Or should we just submit a numbered list of answers for each question? Please write it in an "essay" format, rather than a numbered list of answers for each question.
MP3 Released Hi All,   MP3 is released now. Please access through Coursera.   MP3 requires to implement PLSA, and will **take more time** to finish than the previous MPs.   The due date is **Oct 23th 11:59PM** CT. Please take care of the time schedule and **start as early as possible**.   **Update**:  (10/8) Please clone the latest version of MP3.   Thanks,  Yuxiang
Week1-Quiz Hi,  my Course start date is Aug 22,but the quiz deadline shows on courser is Aug21. It is completely impossible for me to finish this quiz on Aug 21. Please assist.Same here. The deadline is currently incorrect (you will be given a few days to finish the Week 1 quiz). We will fix and let you know the deadlines for the Week 1 quizzes by tomorrow. Same Thank you! Could you extend the deadline a bit longer? I was just been added to the Illinois campus and they said it needs about 24-48 hours for being added to this course. Thank you. The deadline is set to August 28, 11:59 PM, so you still have time till Sunday. Can you get back to me if you are not added to the course by tomorrow? Thank you. Of course! quiz 1 deadline is still set to August 21 PDT on coursera. quiz 2 deadline is set to August 28 PDT on coursera. is this correct? or should we add 1 week to all the quiz deadlines? (could you make a post about the deadlines[or directly update them on cousera], it is confusing if the coursera deadlines are not up to date with what you said)![Screenshot of quiz deadlines](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b6386497-7656-4b5f-80a5-a57102ba196b/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-22%20at%208.04.14%20PM.png) I noticed this as well. It currently still says on the "Week 1 Quiz" that the due date is still August 21. Will this date be updated on Coursera as well? Thanks. That's strange. It was updated earlier in the morning.

Lecture 9.3 Probabilistic Topic models Hello,  I don't get this behabior 2: high frequency words get higher p(w|θd). why we need to have multiple dot procduct for word "the"? As we learned before, we want to exclued common words, such as "the". why we want to assign hign p(w|θd) to word "the"? ![9.3.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3eed6fbb-3867-4353-a3a3-037c0c65300d/9.3.png)I believe what you're referring to as a dot product operator is just an ellipsis to represent that many more instances of "the" are present, but omitted from the graphic for brevity.  You're intuition is correct in that we often seek to reduce the influence of stop words, but in this scenario, we're looking to determine the likelihood of our mixture model generating document $$d'$$ which *legitimately* contains the stop word "the" many times. In order to adjust our model's parameters so our model achieves a high maximum likelihood of generating $$d'$$, we have to increase the probability that the model will produce the word "the" in response to an increase in frequency of that word. As the lecture says, this could be done in a couple of ways. Either by increasing $$p("the"|\theta_d)$$, or by increasing $$p(\theta_B)$$, the probability that the mixture model chooses to generate a word from the background model, which itself already assigns a high probability to "the".
MP3 Permission Denied Issue Hello, I'm getting this error in livedatalab, not sure what it means because it says that permission is denied to a specific folder. Below is the attached screenshot.   ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-16%20at%207.56.35%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9a7ae469-f73a-48e2-85e6-87d4aabc7d2b/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-16%20at%207.56.35%20PM.png)May be you can check the document path declared in your code. I have initialized documents_path = 'data/test.txt' and it worked for me without the permission denied error.  perfect thank you!
alpha sub-D? In week 4, there are several formulas that contain a variable, alpha sub-d. What is this variable represent?  One of the slides highlights it in a denominator position as being the query-likelihood representation of IDF. That would make me guess that it is the number of document in a collection containing the word, w?  If so, then what is n in the following part of this equation?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/293640e7-4c4d-4622-9bf6-e8f32e7f8925/image.png)    Some other references to variable below.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c3f439ef-d5b3-435d-a936-5cb2da7cec20/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/15238059-fc5b-4213-b1a6-9e783b1683c3/image.png) From my understanding, $$\alpha_d$$ denotes the parameter to determine how much we distribute the probability for unseen words.  $$p(w|d) = \begin{cases} p_{seen}(w|d)\\ \alpha_d p(w|C) \end{cases}$$  $$n$$ denotes the query length. I think it is more intelligible to use $$|q|$$ instead of $$n$$.  I hope this helps and would appreciate any feedback on my understanding.   based on my understanding, alpha-d is the smoothing parameter. it controls the mass to be assigned for the unseen words and appropriately discounts some probability from the seen word in the document. Thanks Yutaro. Intuitively that would make sense: effectively we're discounting a word's probability when we have to pull it from the Collection or Background model because it's not in our document. That make sense because we probably would place more value on a word probability coming straight from our document model vs one coming from the background model. Agreed. Thank you.
Naming Convention and Folder Structure of Project Repo in GitHub Hi,   I was wondering if there is any document that mentions the naming convention and folder structure we should follow when submitting project materials? such as for the proposal, what should be the filename and should I put it under the root folder of the repo?  Can someone please advise?  Thanks I have not found yet but if you click on the former semesters' submission, they seem to follow one format. And there is a post mentions to include group name and some other imformation The link in the instruction on week 9 proposal submission task says there is no naming convention.   BTW, there are so many documents, instructions, forms used in this course and it is very easy to miss information. Why can't we stick to Coursera?   Also we used different platforms to upload the homework of this course. But I feel: livedata one does not seem secured enough with frequent connection issues; and CMT seems like something more serious than a homework that we have to register without another choice.   Whereas in other courses provided by UIUC, all the similar tasks can just be explained and finished within Coursera. No, there is no naming convention. As long as each milestone is easily findable + clearly named, then you should be fine. If I recall correctly, Coursera does (or did) not support (1) auto-grading MPs, and (2) group-based peer reviews. This is why we use LiveDataLab and CMT, respectively.  Both of these are not only fully supported, but extensively leveraged in many other courses in the program. This is likely the source of this student’s point of reference.  Off the top of my head, auto-graded MPs were supported in: - Applied Machine Learning - Deep Learning for Healthcare  While peer review was heavily featured in: - Every MOOC in the Cloud Computing Specialization - Every MOOC in the Data Mining Specialization (including the two based on this course)  IIRC, the MOOCs also leveraged auto-graded MPs, but it’s been a while. Thanks for the information and feedback! We will look into using this for future iterations to make the course easier. 
MP2.3 is it normal to get a very large p-value? I was varying parameters for the two ranking functions and picked some values that output a relatively large mean average precision. But when I'm doing the significance test the p value I got is very large (larger than 1). Is it normal or does it mean the parameters I picked are still not good enough?I did not change any parameters when comparing to the ones in the example.  My assumption is that you mean the ranker BM25 parameters?  I did have an issue where I did not create the additional files of inl2.avg_p.txt and bm25.avg_p.txt initially thinking all we needed was the significance.txt.    This was not the case because it seems the auto-grader uses the other 2 files to verify your significance.txt p-value.  Hope this helps! I think p value is a probability, so it should not be larger than 1. I would also double check the p value function if other things look good. Check if your output is in scientific notation rather than a float. Thanks that solved me problem!
MP 2.3 Issue When I run search_eval.py, my code only performs the print statement "Usage: {} config.toml" as seen in the screenshot and then seems to exit, as the rest of the code under it does not run.   How do i resolve this? ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-22%20at%201.08.44%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/13b52495-99a7-4c42-8c84-9613a6d307f1/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-22%20at%201.08.44%20AM.png)You can run the code locally as: ``` python search_eval.py config.toml ```  My issue with running locally is that it will give me an error in importing metapy since my conda environment for python version 3.7 only works when i change the python interpreter in VSCode. When I run locally, the python version is 3.8.9 even when I have activated my conda environment where i set the version to 3.7.  The issue here I believe is that you may not be providing the parameters when running the code. Make sure you are running the code as specified in the usage message: ``` python search_eval.py config.toml ``` You can do this from within your conda environment. Running the following ``` python search_eval.py ``` will cause the system to exit and not run. I had the same problem - what i did was simply redirect the [cfg] towards my local file location by replacing "cfg = sys.argv[1]" with "cfg = local file dir//config.toml" I am running python 3.5.6 under Conda. You can create a new environment and install this version of python there. Then you can install and import metapy inside. This works for me.
Pause working on MP2.1 and above As already mentioned in other posts, we are still working on making MP2.1 and later MPs work for the students (they have been locked for now and will be released later). We suggest that you focus on the weekly quizzes and MP1 for now. We will let you know via a note once the further MPs are released.
kernel appears to have died Hi, I was able to get MP1 instruction working, but I can't do the last step of load an analyzer from this configuration file.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/27547ccb-c1f9-4bf3-b01a-c80acd01981c/image.png)  What should I check?The reason has found.
Are the due dates of quizzes and assignments on Coursera correct?   Hi there, I just saw the course appeared on my Cousera one hour ago. I saw the due dates of Week 1 activities are the night of tomorrow, Aug 22. So we only have about one day to learn all stuff of Week 1 and complete the two quizzes (one for the course information and one for Week 1 module)?   Besides, it seems that all quizzes and assignments are due on Monday of the corresponding weeks, so we must study and do assignments ahead, is this intended?  ![image2022-08-21%2020%3A32%3A46.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/5be6f9af-8031-4207-9c6f-f842bbe2770a/image2022-08-21%2020%3A32%3A46.jpg)![image2022-08-21%2020%3A32%3A53.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/74879363-15a4-40cd-b943-edc7b01055c8/image2022-08-21%2020%3A32%3A53.jpg)This is from the orientation section readings.  It looks like for quizzes 1-6 the hard deadline is end of week 7.  Course Deadlines, Late Policies, and Academic Calendar Course Deadlines Quizzes Assignment  Release Date  Hard Deadline  Quiz 1  First day of class  End of Week 7  Quiz 2  First day of class  End of Week 7  Quiz 3  First day of class  End of Week 7  Quiz 4  First day of class  End of Week 7  Quiz 5  First day of class  End of Week 7  Quiz 6  First day of class  End of Week 7  Quiz 7  First day of class  End of Week 13  Quiz 8  First day of class  End of Week 13  Quiz 9  First day of class  End of Week 13  Quiz 10  First day of class  End of Week 13  Quiz 11  First day of class  End of Week 13  Quiz 12  First day of class  End of Week 13 Also, The hard deadline is the deadline after which you will receive 0 points on assignments regardless how well you did on the assignment. No late submission will be accepted except under extremely rare non-academic circumstances (which usually require approval from the Dean's office).  Each week's Quiz is due on Sunday. Late quiz submissions will be accepted up until the Hard Deadline. However, a late penalty of 5% will be deducted daily until a submission is made or the grade reaches 0%. Oh, I see. So they should be due on Sunday for full credits at least. But they are due on Monday currently.  Looks like that to me! Because you're not using PST Should we use the timezone PST, not CDT or CST? ![Capture.JPG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/40074946-2126-4f36-b021-380c03420bdb/Capture.JPG)  Obviously, it is not correct because it is showing Sunday (Aug 21) as the deadline Actually, the due time is Aug 22, 1:59 AM CDT, which is kind of impossible for me to finish one week's stuff with the four hours left. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6f140558-0a5b-41ad-b8c3-4b9f843ebb3e/image.png) I agree, I think this is now obviously a mistake. Mine is showing Aug 21 hahahaha Yeh, it depends on the timezone you set on Coursera. My Coursera hasn't even been added yet. I'm stressing out. Am I about to lose 5% on all the Week 1 stuff now? same issue with me .Can someone please help? The official start date of Fall 2022 is tomorrow, I do not think the due date is correct. Let us see what our professor and TAs will say tomorrow. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/56a448b0-f3e5-4b9a-8d17-11d8f1803785/image.png) isn't this getting stressful already?  :( The deadline is incorrect. We will fix the deadlines by tomorrow and let you know. Cool! Thank you so much. This must be a typo! We'll correct it. As the discussion thread has already clarified, the hard deadlines for those quizzes are quite late. Thanks to those of you who provided all the useful information and helped clarifying things!  I think the course staff will fix that tomorrow. Hi Harita. Has the fix been implemented yet? It is still showing Aug 21 as the deadline at my end (PST) and it is overdue now
How to confirm that MP1 is complete? I think I've completed MP1 and I see my submission on the LiveDataLab Leaderboard but I don't see any sort of completion feedback (like a green checkmark) on Coursera.  I just wanted to double check what the expected behavior is after completing one of these assignments. Are there any actions I need to take to ensure I get credit in Coursera? You just have to make sure that you open the LiveDataLab link through Coursera MP1 link. Once you add, commit, push again you will see the grades on Coursera instantly. That is how it worked for me. Hope that helps! Hey please see our discussion in #155. Hope it's helpful. you can check the coursera grade. if it's 100%, it means you have complete and got the full credit.
MP2.3 submission I can see the submission history at home page, but nothing in the grading update in MP2.3 site. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/61ba2bf9-5ea3-41de-ae73-627514f7c820/image.png) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d04a2d36-ab59-4933-b2e6-598e199608d8/image.png)Press Leaderboard to see if you are graded. this is the leaderboard page ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/775b76a7-2033-48f0-92e2-692380822f79/image.png) There seems to be errors in your later submissions.  Attempt to click on your latest submission to see if there are any logs that would inform you of what went wrong, such as livedatalab not having any modules named scipy Looks like you are trying to import numpy, you shouldn't need to import this package to finish the MP I fixed it, thank you very much! I fixed it, thank you very much!
Log Likelihood not monotonically increasing I have the same problem as someone else did two days ago. My iterations with the test data look like this: ``` Iteration #25... -224237.83429232525 Iteration #26... -214537.26590018562 Iteration #27... -207431.20891021765 Iteration #28... -202872.2076288436 Iteration #29... -200336.91548889066 Iteration #30... -199202.84835355126 Iteration #31... -198950.43153064366 Iteration #32... -199210.35306954256 Iteration #33... -199743.62552057777 Iteration #34... -200401.6875146974 Iteration #35... -201091.9353962618 Iteration #36... -201756.27025680034 Iteration #37... -202359.3163707304 Iteration #38... -202881.37697428238 Iteration #39... -203313.6169861956 Iteration #40... -203654.5906963647 Iteration #41... -203907.724130878 Iteration #42... -204079.4847899975 Iteration #43... -204178.1263822302 Iteration #44... -204212.87140975398 Iteration #45... -204193.2891203349 Iteration #46... -204128.71431173678 Iteration #47... -204027.75383974507 Iteration #48... -203897.98950528604 Iteration #49... -203745.89750533825 ``` As you can see, it goes from -224k to -198k to -204k and then back up where it converges at -197864.11650778833 at Iteration #931  Someone replied to check if the E-Step and M-Step were setting variables correctly. My E-Step sets self.topic_prob; my M-Step sets self.topic_word_prob and self.document_topic_prob.  Any ideas for why my log likelihood is not monotonically increasing? Also, if anyone has solved this issue, any tips? Rachel, You may wish to check the normalizations in both E-step and M-step against the lecture equations and constraints. Not normalizing, or normalizing along the wrong axis, could cause likelihood to behave like this.
question about remove 0 and 1 on build_corpus Hello, it might be a dumb question, but I'm wondering how to remove 0 and 1 at the start of the first 100 lines?Can you post a screenshot so I can see what problem you are trying to address. I did not remove the 0 and 1 list.remove() can do that. You can do it for test purpose, but when submit to grader you don't need to remove them. I too did not remove 0 & 1 from the list.  what I did was in build vocabulary, I created a set and add to it if word is not 0 and 1 i tried to go for something "generic" by first checking if i could cast the element of the list to an int; if i could, i discarded it. if i couldn't, it was a valid string and i added it to the document. i did this with a try/except block re My understanding is `test.txt` is an example of a collection covering two topics. First 100 lines illustrates what the topics are and dominating words in two topics. It's fine to test the code with the rest 900 lines only. And then check the final `topic_word_prob` matrix to verify whether two topics have reasonable word distributions. The first 100 rows of test.txt seem intended as a training data set: actual topics are specified by 0 or 1 so we could compare to the model results. In any case, the first 100 rows all begin with a digit and a tab character (\t). The remaining 900 rows all begin with a tab but no digit. So, one approach is always to drop the first character. This will remove the digit from the first 100 rows and the leading tab from the other 900 rows, and prevent '0' and '1' from becoming part of the vocabulary.
quiz hi,  how many attempts do we have for quiz?two. max 2 attempts two two Just to add to the other answers: You should be able to see the number of attempts allowed on the quiz page. You can see the number on the page. If not, you can try unlimited.
Textbook Error? In chapter 2.1 of the textbook, the section on conditional probability contains an example problem.   Am I missing something, or is the probability calculation (1/3 vs 1/6) incorrect here?  Thank you!  ![comp410_textbook_error1.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e877b042-03c9-4beb-8384-c4826bd2112f/comp410_textbook_error1.PNG)  ![comp410_textbook_error2.PNG](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/66805c19-80cf-400d-8f8a-e812d5de7498/comp410_textbook_error2.PNG) Check the paragraph that opens the conditional probability discussion in your first screenshot: "Let's use the original die with six unique colors". The author is moving back to the probability space where item 4 is a blue circle. Item 4 being a green circle was for the joint probability discussion.
MP1 Grade on Coursera Hi All,  I submitted MP1 a few days ago and made sure the scoring shows a 1. However, on Coursera, I haven't seen a grade for the assignment yet. Is anyone experiencing the same issue? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c541c979-7de4-42d0-ba7c-c43a41673842/image.png)![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/71ab51a6-00c8-482b-959d-9f24fde349bc/image.png)Did you access the MP via the "Open Tool" button in Coursera? Or alternatively, by logging directly into LivaDataLab and then navigating to the MP?  Only speculating here, but wondering if that has something to do with establishing the connection between the two.  I'm not able to find it (yet) but I vaguely recall instructions advising us to *only* use the Coursera link to start MPs. I just tried to resubmit by clicking the link through Coursera...that did the trick! I now see 100% as the grade. Thank you for your help! ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ec328276-a8ef-4a83-a7d1-60d414647e11/image.png) Hey Ginna, wondering what happened when you clicked the link? I am having the same issue however clicking the lick does not help. For me, after clicking the "open tool" button from coursera MP1 page it just asked me to go into LiveDataLab and after which nothing happened... Many thanks. Hey Hanyin,  Yes, what you describe was what I saw as well. All I did was make sure I accessed the MP1 through Coursera. Then navigate to my IDE (I'm using Pycharm) and re-push the code out to GitHub (this should resubmit the assignment again to LiveDataLab). Within seconds I saw my grade on Coursera. Let me know if you're still having issues! Thank you so much! I just tried this and magically it worked! Many thanks! Just adding if it helps anyone, Another way to go about this from Github is to go to your Settings in Github, hit Webhooks, go to the link mentioned there (this should open the web hook you created), hit recent deliveries, and hit the redelivery button and follow the instructions to redeliver. This worked out for me and the grades showed up on Coursera
Average score about the MP2.4 I have tested all the listed rankers and the inL2 ranker created in MP2.3 and have had no luck scoring 1 after 23 tries.  I did the grid search of the optimal parameters for relative rankers by testing only the Cranfield data before submitting it to the liveDataLab. The problem is that the best parameter+ranker never gives me a score >0.35 for Cranfield data. I am not surprised that the test will fail in the liveDataLab.  Please provide more hints to pass the test. Thanks a lot!I actually found that setting the parameters around default suggested values tends to be good starting point and it gives a fairly decent score. Grid search is a good starting point. Remember that the best parameters one dataset (e.g., Cranfield) may not be the best for another dataset (e.g., faculty). Also keep in mind that the Cranfield data is only weighted at 30% of the composite score and the faculty data is weighted at 60% - so in this environment, attempts should focus more towards maximizing the faculty score even at the expense of the AP and Cranfield scores (to a certain degree). As a hint, I found that even seemingly insignificantly small changes of some parameters can have a significant impact on certain scores, so make sure that your grid search isn't taking too large of steps. Steve, Have you been able to test against the faculty database without submitting? It is frustrating to see Pivot length ranker failed after testing 20 values with an interval of 0.1 It was interesting, I was able to overfit the Cranfield data and get a poor score when I submitted my search_eval.py. I don't believe you can do that. This is correct to my understanding. It's a commit and push to remote for each parameter test, unfortunately Thank you both! You are correct: I just checked with the TAs. I was hoping for a better process. 
Question about JM smoothing - Effect of Lamda Since lambda ranges from 0 to 1, it would mean when,  1. lambda is close to 0 => p(w|D) is close to ML Estimator   2. lambda is close to 1 => p(w|D) is close to language modelYour understand is correct, what is your question? Thank you. Was just confirming. Absolutely
Delta encoding example ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-04%20at%2010.49.50%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d826242d-98db-46fd-99ef-eb0cf22dcd37/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-04%20at%2010.49.50%20AM.png)  Could someone decompose the steps for getting the delta code of 3 as 1001.  Thanks a lot!let's first understand how we get gamma code. 1. how to map 3 to unary code "110"? step 1, we need 3 - 1= 2 digits of "1"  step 2, we need it to be followed by 1 digit of "0". So we have "110"   the total digits ("110" has 3 digits) of the mapping means the actual number value 3.  Now let's see how we map 3 into gamma code? 1. gamma code has two parts, first part is unary code, the second part is uniform code. The unary code part value is 1+ floor(log x ), so it is actually has floor(log x) digits of "1" and then "0". For example, if x is 3, btw the log here is base of 2, not base of e or base of 10, then floor(log 3) is 1. so we will have just 1 digit of "1" and then "0". Then, the rest part is the uniform code of 3-2**(floor(log 3)) = 1 in (floor (log 3)) bits, so it's just "1". That's why we have 3 -> "101"   Next, how we map 3 to delta code? Remember in gamma code we have unary code part and uniform code part?  for 3, the unary code part is "10" and uniform code part is "1". So for delta code, we just need to replace the unary code part to be gamma code. The unary code part "10" means 2, so we need the gamma code of 2. The gamma code of 2 is actually "100". That's why we have "100" + "1" = "1001" to be the delta code of 3.  I don't know if you can follow it. Any suggestion is welcome! I was able to follow through! Thank you so much for the detailed explanation! Ojasvi, I made a spreadsheet to understand better the calculation and efficiency of different encodings. Here is a picture. I hope it can be helpful to others. ![Bit_encodings.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/30bd7359-73d3-4ef0-a740-8488e2700e48/Bit_encodings.png)  Thanks!

webhook issue ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-30%20at%206.57.15%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6fa1d494-3238-4579-ae7d-a55a2d87fb1a/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-30%20at%206.57.15%20PM.png)  the webhook is still not working for me. the link I used is  http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger when I git add, commit, push no submission shows upIf it helps, similar issue & the fix has been discussed at https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/25 I think a lot of people are having issues with the webhook right now- it looks like the error now is a 500 Internal Server Error. You can find this if you click on the webhook and go to Recent Deliveries -> Response. The submission history on livedatalab also does not seem to load at the moment. Ok that makes sense. Hopefully this can get fixed soon then. Try to delete and readd, should be up and running again Looks like redelivering the payload is working now. Thanks! However, I still cannot see my submission history of any of my submissions on livedatalab. Are there any additional steps I could take? works now, thank you! I'm having the same issue! Wondering what I can do. You may not be able to see your old submissions, but scores will still be recorded on Coursera. Your new submissions should appear on the submission history.
Successully submitted but there is no score log. I re-did the whoe process twice, but still not work....  I hope we can use a new system like Jupyter Notebook..  This can save a lot of our time.  I see the tests passed on our backend. Looks like you've linked the same github account multiple times ... likely why you are facing an issue. You might need to relink the github account again after this MP.  Regarding Jupyter Notebook, what I did was write my code there, and then paste it into the example.py file in order to submit it. I was unable to figure out how to install metapy locally, but doing so was easy on Jupyter Notebook.
Will we able to see what questions we got wrong in exam1? As title.after 17 I'm not sure. But, since this is marked as resolved, is anyone able to see
[OPTIONAL] content of the lecture Will the optional lessons (like the below screenshot) be included in the exams? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a9ef74ab-6cd1-4492-82db-3c8a25df3fa5/image.png)  Thank you!It is highly possible that these optional lectures won't be included in the exams, but you are expected to double check the review lectures for information about exams.
Release of MP 3? Is it possible to release MP 3 soon? Have some free time now and would like to get started on MP 3 as soon as possible. Otherwise it is hard to balance between project, midterm, and work travels during that week. In addition - If possible please release other MPs as well if they are ready. For working professionals like me , we can try and complete them and save some extra time for project given our working schedules. Actually  MP3 should have been released this past Monday according to the syllabus/course deadline. ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-30%20at%205.54.27%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/85fa73e6-b921-4815-acb7-c46f9ae72e2e/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-30%20at%205.54.27%20PM.png)   We plan to release it on Monday.

Project update! Hello everyone,  I hope you all are enjoying the semester so far. This note is to provide you with an update on the course project plan.  It is time to start thinking about groups/topics for the course project. The timeline can be found [on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/vtHNZ/course-project-overview). The first deadline is October 17th, where you must form a team. Please see the beginning of the Overview Section of [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-EagO17Og7_ESj5hkP5x4EFrVPQAtBlH9YvsgEzjnY/edit) for instructions about the sign-up sheet and about CMT (platform that we are using to manage submissions, peer grading). To reiterate the document ****all students must create a CMT account****.  Moreover, if you notice any inconstancies or have any trouble, please let us know.   For the topic selection and proposal submission (deadline October  23rd), the directions for the CMT submission process can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFvippp_jyiUUXpWsps4Geh5KsyZRkJq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115921160486510493648&rtpof=true&sd=true). Only one team member should make the submission, but they should add all team members under the Authors section. After you add the Github repo link, you can put all submitted content in the repo, and peer reviewers will be able to visit your repo link to find your project content.  Looking forward to seeing your projects!  -Kevin 
Running Search Eval I keep getting the error "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." when trying to run python search_eval.py config.toml are you inside python environment? You have to activate python first If you are using anaconda prompt, make sure you are activating the virtual environment by typing conda activate <your python environment>, this should resolve it you get that error because there is no executable named python on your machine or you do not have the PATH updated for the python executable.  Check where you have installed python and make sure you have the path ready.   Problem is no one can actually say why it would happen on your machine unless someone actually looks at your machine.
MP2.1 Where to Check the Queries I Submitted Hello, I was wondering how do we check to see the queries we inserted specifically?Go to "my submissions" after signing in here: http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000/auth I noticed that all of the submissions are different than the ones I submitted, is this normal? For me, http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000/auth shows me all my submissions with the highlighted text Hi Da'Mon,  Do you mind explaining a bit more about what you're seeing / how they're different than the ones that you submitted?  I was actually searching "My Submissions" in the search bar so that was the issue.
Cisco vpn connection failure I have been trying to connect my vpn for a bit now and I keep getting the two popups down below. It has been a while since I've used the vpn but it has worked before, I'm just confused as to what I'm missing as everything on my laptop seems to be running fine in the background. Does anyone have any suggestions or know what the issue is? ![2022-09-10%20%284%29.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7f6c1bfd-569d-499d-b5a7-92081c7d9e87/4635ca02-b184-4379-95e6-c834cff4b208/2022-09-10%20%284%29.png)  ![2022-09-10%20%285%29.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7f6c1bfd-569d-499d-b5a7-92081c7d9e87/326e4481-cae6-4c1e-9625-036effc6e1ea/2022-09-10%20%285%29.png)Are you using vpn.illinois.edu? Yea, every time I log in it comes up with this screen and then a couple minutes later it gives me the two photos from before ![2022-09-10%20%287%29.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d08af3e8-b9ad-4543-aa62-c443813ac385/2022-09-10%20%287%29.png) There is a support line number on the VPN webside. May be you should try calling them. I copied from that website here. > Please contact the Technology Services Help Desk at consult@illinois.edu or (217)244-7000 for support. I would try updating the VPN software and checking the firewall. How can I check the firewall? Ok I finally got it to work, not entirely sure how but its working at least One of the ways, is to restart your computer especially if this is the first time you are trying to connect to a VPN.
Do we need to wait for a grade on the technology review proposal Do we need to wait for a grade on the technology review proposal before we start working on the technology review paper or is it fine to start working on it now?Hey!  My understanding is that the Tech Review is separate from the course project. We simply choose a topic in tech that we would like to review and write a 2 page paper of it. ( I wasn't sure if you were referring to the Technology review or not, so I included the syllabus excerpt for it) Here is the tech review sign up sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hWAyxd82FcitN9eG3yMW6ckq6l1VASBtYWpaPbywMPc/edit?usp=sharing  And the tech review topic selection sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yeKm8hJbyRGhiUDvZv9-S3Zzu5hDtET-O6Yeci-VPOs/edit?usp=sharing  *Tech Review (for 4-credit students). It will require you to generate a short 1-2 page review on an interesting course-related cutting-edge technology topic not covered in any lecture.*  *Final Course Project. There will also be one culminating project due at the end of course. It will require you to work in groups of at most three. You will build a tool using methods from the course to perform data analysis and also generate documentations and presentation.* -course syllabus  For the final project, typically we can start without the proposal feedback, but if the TA's have significant feedback it can alter the work you may have already completed. It may be beneficial to wait for feedback if you have chosen an out of the box free topic, but if you feel confident or have chosen one of the 4 main topic themes, you should be fine to begin your implementation.   *For all the categories, the instructors will meta-review your project proposals (following a peer-review round by other students) and provide feedback. If we find your project topic/plan has some limitations, we will provide suggestions to improve it or suggest you pick one of the sample topics. You’re allowed to change topics after the proposal stage based on our feedback. If you have not received any suggestion from the instructors, you can generally assume that your project proposal is fine and you can proceed to carry out the proposed project work.* -CS 410 Project Topics document found under project instructions  Here are the project instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFvippp_jyiUUXpWsps4Geh5KsyZRkJq/edit  And the project topic sheet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-EagO17Og7_ESj5hkP5x4EFrVPQAtBlH9YvsgEzjnY/edit Ok so to reword my question, after you have signed up for a topic in the tech review sheet, can you immediately start working on the tech review paper or do we need to wait for something.  I believe that you can start working on the tech review paper as the content has been described on week 9 of coursera. You don't need to wait for anything. It's better to start early as it will due soon, also the same due time as MP4. I am not seeing an MP4 in the grade summary or in the weekly assignment information. Could you please expand on this?  What I know is that there will be a MP4 soon.  It feels very late in the semester to be adding another unscheduled assignment, as well as modifying the current MP grade structure as many of us work and have planned our schedules weeks to months in advance. When can we expect more information to be released as november 6th is 13 days away? I'm sorry for that. It seems that at the beginning of this semester the instructor has mentioned MP4. I'm not sure when it will be released. Another TA Daniel, who specializes in MP4 will announce soon and start his OHs. Thank you for the information
Lecture 9.2 Typo  It seems there is a typo here:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/abb6f4ac-b46f-4eff-bfb2-83e3b081ed1f/image.png)Thanks for catching the typo! I'll correct it. 
lecture 2.1 IDF I do not quite understand where are these IDF values coming from. Can anyone help? I understand the equation mentioned in the previous slide which is log[(M+1)/K]. But how are these values calculated from this equation?![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-10%20at%2010.38.39%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/37a2c19f-83ee-4bbb-8c0d-2a4d66f33e81/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-10%20at%2010.38.39%20PM.png)I don't recall exactly if this was used an example based on the previous examples used in the lecture. I am not sure if the slide had listed the specific occurrences of the term in terms of the number of document it exists and total number.  I feel it just gives an intuition of how it works. Basically, rare words get high IDF where as common words get lower IDF.  I feel these numbers are just representative of how IDF value of the one word(a rare word)  would look like comparative to that of other words (commonly occurring word).  Thank you that’s how I feel but wanted to make sure  It is just representational, to capture the idea that IDF for rare words tend to be high
practice quiz 10 ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1cf9c95c-5f50-46da-9c88-e52b22229caf/image.png) Don't understand the option 1 here.my interpretation of the meaning of option 1:  we need a similarity measure to indicate whether a data point belongs to a specific cluster, to compare it to other points (or maybe a centroid) in the cluster. for example, maybe we use euclidean distance. in model-based clustering algorithms, is it challenging to substitute the euclidean distance measure for another similarity measure, like the dot product, or pearson correlation coefficient? or is it easy to swap those similarity measures out? Unlike similarity-based approaches where we can explicitly specify a particular similarity function to inject a particular view of similarity, in model-based approaches, there is no direct/easy way to control the similarity measure (the similarity measure is implicitly determined in the model). They do not give us the flexibility of specifying a particular view of how things should be measured as similar.
Topics for Tech Review Hi, How are you selecting the topics for tech review paper? There are no papers listed in the excel sheet, we just randomly search on the net and find a paper. And do a tech review of it?  ThanksHi, We are provided with some sample topics to choose from under the Week 1 Tech Review content. If we don't pick any of those, there are certain requirements to make sure that the topic is related to the course. This is all available under Week 1 Tech review I chose the topics that have the paper provided
Initial Proposal Deadline I see in W1, initial proposal deadline is oct 23 but in week 9 it shows as oct 17. Which is the right deadline to follow ?It should be October 23rd. I've changed the proposal deadline in week 9 to October 23rd.   Thanks for pointing this out! Thanks a lot! 
confused on Statistical significance testing I am a bit confused on what we are supposed to do with this portion, I just run my code using "python search_eval.py config.toml" in terminal and get the average precision value and put in the significance file, is it good enough?  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-23%20at%209.45.32%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b7db0252-b1b1-4b25-97f4-4083c0c62305/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-23%20at%209.45.32%20PM.png)You need to compute the p-value between two different datasets, which are: 1. APs from your BM25 ranker 2. APs from your InL2 ranker  One way to do this is to write the APs in 2 separate text files and read them to compute the p-value. The python method is provided in readme please take a look. You just need to pass 2 arrays of APs into the function.  Or you can just create the 2 arrays directly in search_eval.py and calculate the p-value. But I think the auto-grader doesn't recognize scipy, and you need to do the calculation elsewhere.  I also have questions about this part. is the avg_p here the list of average precisions from 225 queries?  Do we need to find the best value of a chosen parameter for this relative ranker? Thanks! yes, I believe you need to copy your 225 results to two separate .txt files and read in them to use the function in the instruction, but I am getting some TypeError here.. Thank you! I did what you said. I created two .txt and saved my 225 AP results in each of them. I read in the two files and use stats.ttest_rel(A, B). however it gives me this error, do you know why?![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-23%20at%2011.19.37%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/7ec74fc7-68b9-46c1-b9f9-a91aa596f6af/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-23%20at%2011.19.37%20PM.png) What are "a" and "b" here in your line? It looks like their type does not support the minus operand. I am not sure what you are trying to do here. You just need to pass your 2 arrays into the function and you get the p-value. thank you, I figured it out. 
MP2.3 - No module named scipy Hello TAs,  FYI, it seems like there is no spicy package in the grading environment ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/dff6c555-195d-4417-9014-641f5224961f/image.png)  The submission is passed once I removed the spicy code and keep the calculated signficiant.txt in the directory  ThanksI didn't remove my scipy code. I created a separate file to do the t-test. Everything looked fine for me and I got full grade on Coursera.  I believe because the grader will not run your separate python file that's why you didn't get the error I think so. It only checks the search_eval.py and significance.txt.
Error Installing metapy on Windows 10 Hello, I am having problems installing metapy on my Windows machine (Python 3.10, CMAKE and all support libraries installed.) I am getting the following error: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4cc9c74c-6ad7-48d6-b7a5-ac73fcaf8d05/image.png) I have verified that all the binaries in the system path as well. Any ideas? Unfortunately metapy only works with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7.  You can keep Python 3.10 as your default and do an altinstall of 3.7, then run any scripts related to this class under 3.7  Reposting my solution from #28: I got metapy to work by installing Python 3.7 and then using the appropriate cp37 built distribution from here:  https://pypi.org/project/metapy/#files  You can install a built distribution using pip install <whl_url> where <whl_url> is the appropriate link for your environment from the PyPI metapy link above. Thank you, this fixed my issue. Even I was unable to get metapy to install correctly on my computer. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy works natively there. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153  
Final project done independently?  I just saw the project requirement from week 6 and that team formation is required.   Could TA confirm that final project can still be done independently? I have a hard time finding teammates due to working in the CEST timezone in Europe.   ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-25%20at%2010.50.10%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c8236daa-ef7d-4024-90c5-52dd8e5d7d17/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-25%20at%2010.50.10%20PM.png)from the project topics description document in the final project proposal submission [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-EagO17Og7_ESj5hkP5x4EFrVPQAtBlH9YvsgEzjnY/edit): >  Because the course project is only one of the many tasks that you have to complete for this course, we do not expect you to spend more than 20 hours of quality time on the coding part of the project. For a group of N students, the expectation is 20*N hours total. Thus, you are strongly encouraged to form a team to work with others so that you can accomplish something more substantial than what you can on your own. In fact, we also encourage multiple teams to coordinate with each other for potential integration of multiple projects so as to maximize the impact of your course project work.  If you can combine your effort to finish a larger project successfully, you would all be able to mention this accomplishment on your resume as your course project for CS410.  from that it sounds like 1 person teams are fine, you just need to tackle a project that should take $$\sim 20*N$$ hours to complete, with `N` being the number of members on the team (in this case N=1). i also plan to do the project independently  can wait for TA to confirm though Yes, the final project can be done independently.  Yes. Make sure your project is 20 hours effort atleast. 
Technology Review + Project Progress Report Due Dates The due time is at 1:59am for these two assignments rather than 11:59pm like most of the others. Seeing as they're the odd ones out I'm assuming this is an error.

Question on Document length normalization The BM25 TF transformation with Document Length normalization formula is like this:  $$f(q,d)=\sum_{w \in q \cap d}c(w,q) \frac{c(w,d)(k+1)}{c(w,d)+k(1-b+b\frac{|d|}{avdl})}log\frac{M+1}{df(w)}$$  I wonder why it is not like this: $$f(q,d)=\sum_{w \in q \cap d}c(w,q) \frac{c(w,d)(k+1)}{(c(w,d)+k)(1-b+b\frac{|d|}{avdl})}log\frac{M+1}{df(w)}$$  Why is the normalizer only multiplied to the $$k$$, the denominator, not the whole score function $$f(q,d)$$ itself?From a review [here](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf) in page 360, I feel that the direct reason behind the first formula is, $$B=1-b+b\frac{|d|}{avdl}$$ is a factor to directly normalize $$c(w,d)$$, not the TF-transformed result $$\frac{c(w,d)(k+1)}{c(w,d)+k}$$. So the middle term is originally $$\frac{\frac{c(w,d)}{B}(k+1)}{\frac{c(w,d)}{B}+k}$$ which is equal to the first expression But I am also expecting a deeper explanation of why choosing this formulation. One thought: if using the second formulation, the upper bound is no longer $$k+1$$.  The deeper philosophy is probably this: document length might be more closely related to $$c(w,d)$$ than TF-transform, so should be applied first, and TF-transform second. Sounds very reasonable. Thank you for a detailed explanation and sharing your thoughts! thank you too for this inspiring question! inspiring discussions

question about the M step ![Screenshot%202022-10-19%20234143.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c430a1d5-4282-467c-9668-48e18b5b478e/Screenshot%202022-10-19%20234143.png). I try to label the terms in the MP3 code to the equations in the lecture note.  From the equation, I believe the nominator can be obtained by dot product between matrices. and the denominator means the normalization of the product matrix. however, I don't know to match the dimensions of the matrice. It is confusing to me. Is there any good tutorial demonstrating how to convert the arithmetic equation to matrix equation? Thanks!I will try to attend today's office hour. Take a look at this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4455076/how-do-i-access-the-ith-column-of-a-numpy-multidimensional-array  For example if you do something like ``` self.topic_prob[:, 0][:, 0] ``` This will give you a 1-D array that contains all the topic probs of the 1st word for the 1st topic among all the documents. This method allowed me to match dimensions of matrices so I could do the dot product TA is  not showing up in the office hour. I just hope TAs can respond to this thread at any convenience. Thanks! Please see the update. I'll start OH at 8PM. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you prefer to use matrix operations, make sure you understand the calculation process clearly and first get yourself familiar with numpy functions such as dot, matmul, *, @, and also take a look at the broadcast. In addition, Abi seems to present a good point below. 
Tips on MP2.3 submission If you see a score of 1 in the livedatalab MP2.3 Leaderboard and do not see a score on Coursera, make sure to click through the Coursera MP2.3 link again and re-login to livedatalab, do another empty commit or commit with a small change (e.g. add an empty space) to trigger the autograder again. There seems to be a discoonection between the webhook and coursera that logs you out, if you have been working on the MP for some period of time. 
Will we be able to see which questions we got wrong for Exam 1? Someone asked this already, but we didn't quite get a reply. I was wondering if we are able to somehow see the official solutions, or know the questions we got wrong for exam 1?  The coursera platform has the exam locked currently.  Also, will we able to know the class average and std deviation?  Thanks!Yeah, I am not able to access the Exam Quiz solutions either, but I think they should be available in some time.  Yeah, I can't see which questions I got wrong. wait for the unlock of exam 1 feedback. Not sure the prof will do this, because otherwise he will have to come up with a different set of questions for next year’s course. This is only my guess. In my experience, professors are reluctant to release an answer key online. Best bet is to attend office hours and see if the professor is willing to discuss the exam questions. I guess we will not be able to see it. still no updates?

Thanks a lot in advance.You can try to drag and commit your py file to your Github repo directly. Can you elaborate on it a bit more? I tested the connection between my local file and GitHub remote repo, and it works. If I push something from my local folder, the GitHub repo can reflect the change. I think the problem is the connection between my GitHub and webhook (livedatalab), and I don't quite understand the error code 401, does it mean the webhook cannot find my git account?.... Is there any way I can directly submit my code to livedatalab? Hello, May I ask you if you generated a github token for your livedatalab and set your github username and token into your livedatalab? Looks like your livedatalab can not connect to your Github. How is your webhook set-up? Could you share a screenshot? fantastic! I relinked my github account with PAT and it works! (I don't think I did this step wrongly before because I just followed the instruction and entered my username and PAT. but never mind since it works now) Thank you so much for your help! Now I am able to see my submission on livcdatalab. The screenshot below means I passed the MP1, right? Thanks! ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6a5f57ae-d3ac-402d-a30d-8db98a75f0c0/image.png) Thanks for asking. Dajun solved my problem. I relinked my github with PAT on LiveDataLab and I am able to submit my code now. Thank you all the same. 
MP2.4 baseline score where can we find baseline score?We are still working on to set the baseline score. It is not yet shown on LiveDataLab. Sorry for that! The baseline score is now set to 0.4170671141624618 (per: #583)
Access issue Hello Team, good morning! I'm sorry, not sure if there's a problem with what I'm doing - but I still don't see the course in my Coursera page nor does the link work. The account is on my Illinois account only.  Please feel free to suggest some tips.It might take some days after you register for the course before it appears on your home page. If you registered a long time ago probably emailing Coursera could be a good idea. Hey, Thanks. I'll be emailing them. I registered for this course at least 2-3 weeks back.  I sent an email to uiuc coursera suppot team. They told me that there is a technique issue about account linking invitation. And they are fixing it now. They also told me to wait patiently util they fix it. I didn't see the course in my Coursera either. Wait to see if it can be fixed in the next few hours.  I had the same issue but after emailing the support team and waiting a couple of hours it was resolved and I can now access course content. I believe they're working to resolve the issue on their end. I contacted the staff and they said it will need 24 - 48 hours for them to add me to the course.
Week 7 Practice Quiz ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-05%20at%204.27.14%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/406f8f25-0a85-4def-a984-367fb3850259/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-05%20at%204.27.14%20PM.png)  I am getting an incorrect answer in the practice quiz of week 7 where it is talking about opinion mining/sentiment analysis. According to slides, I feel this is the correct answer, am I missing something here ? I'm attaching a specific slide that is particularly relevant for this question:  ![Screenshot%20from%202022-10-05%2017-38-50.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/cb346cda-401b-4878-9959-0cf161fdd44c/Screenshot%20from%202022-10-05%2017-38-50.png)  This table nicely summarizes the various text representations and how they are used. I also had this same confusion, until I looked for `sentiment analysis` specifically on this slide  it also makes sense thinking about it. in a text conversation, what is the most important thing that gives us context about sentiment? is it structures or the way someone says something? is it the entities/relations involved in the text? or is it the words themselves, which tend to have their own connotations? This helps! Thank you! I respectfully disagree on this question. I feel "words and syntactic structures" should be the answer, because at least we need to know what object that sentiment is associated with.
How flexible are tech review topics? As the title asks, how (un)related a valid review topic can be to the course. I'm interested in machine translation, so I'm wondering if I can choose something related to that despite it not being related to the course content aside from being under the NLP umbrella. Topic example would be understanding the current limitations in machine translation modelsSure, general AI/ML under the NLP umbrella is related to the course!  Awesome, thank you!
Webhook ping fail Github web hook failed to connect with LiveDataLab. Reconnect Github account with new token also no luck. Any suggestions? Thanks! ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d9e7d999-63d2-4fea-b218-91e01a84eba6/image.png) web hook settings ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d398a71e-1949-4400-a5d1-2572fbda6a8b/image.png)Xintei, after generating your new token, please try deleting the webhook and creating a new one. yep that's what I did, but still... Did you also delete linked accounts in LiveDataLab, and then link new account?  yep, delete->new token->link->delete web hook->new web hook When I had a similar experience, I believe that I added the webhook before linking. nah no luck LOL, but really appreciate your replies My only other thought is to recheck the webhook setup for typos (like the now-infamous 'livelab' vs. 'livedatalab'), to confirm content type is 'application/json' (which is not the default), and to be sure that 'just push' and 'active' are checked.  livelab or livedatalab? I used the one from pdf http://livelab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger ha, u know what, YOU are right. it should be http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger PDF has wrong URL LiveDataLab, definitely. No such website as livelab. That document has a typo. not sure how I got it working previously Thanks man! ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/771fadd5-f73a-483b-b30e-e0b86fcba752/image.png) I had the same problem.  I had to unlink my github account with my livedatalab account, generate a new token and then relink my github account with the new token.  I used the delete linked accounts button in the upper right hand corner of the livedatalab screen.  Be careful though, it doesn't ask you to verify your decision!  Just deleting the webhook alone didn't work for me.  I also picked 90 days for the lifetime of the token. found the reason, the LiveDataLab link in PDF is wrong
MP1 grading My submission for MP1 shows a green submission along with this: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/17fa5886-9706-4ad5-9025-8f03e6a1cb2e/image.png)  However, my "score" for the leaderboard is still 0. Does this mean that I did not pass some tests?  You can also check the result on Coursera Grades. It’s quite strange. You can also check your logs generated on LiveDataLab.  If you have less than a 1 on the leaderboard, you didn't pass all the tests. If you have a 0 you didn't pass any of the tests. This [page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/zbBWu/mp1) says: For this MP, if you see a score "1" on the Leaderboard on LiveDataLab,  it means that you have successfully completed the MP and should see a 100% grade on Coursera.  same issue happened. It said build success but score is 0?
About language model Just want to confirm: Is the **maximum likelihood estimate** a (special kind of) **language model**? Usually the ML needs to be smoothed before it can be used as a LM.   Why I ask this question: In lesson 5.3 at 3:04, professor Zhang said that the **P seen (w | d)**  is the document language model.   I would like the instructor or TA to confirm but I am also open to your suggestions. Thank you in advance! The definition given in the textbook best explains what a language model is - A language model is defined as a probability distribution over word sequences. When we have a language model, we can sample word sequences based on the given probability distributions. If we assume a 'unigram language model', we need to calculate p(w|D) for all the words. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is a way to calculate these probabilities for the language model by making the probabilities of the words relative to the frequency of the words in the observed data (i.e, the document D). I would suggest looking at section 3.4 (Statistical Language Models) of Chapter 3 of the textbook.  Thank you! This answered my questions.

To resolve,  I deleted my linked account in LiveDataLab, generated a new personal access token, and then re-linked my github account with the new access token. After that I pushed again and it worked. Hmm...I thought I went through that, but am willing to try anything at this point.  There is a lot of room for bugs in these programs.  Thanks!
Exciting Digital Library Update! Hi everyone,  We have also some very exciting changes to the CS410 Digital Library. It is now called **The Community Digital Library**. This is because we have added functionality to support group creation, where only members of the group can see and search over submitted content. You all should have been automatically added to the "CS410 Fall 2022" community, and to "Your personal community" where you can make private submissions. Please check out the [updated overview document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o8jHEO8xYtfbqThIT8afnRQ7vdfxZ7WqdmvlNxyQ_wI/edit?usp=sharing) for a complete description of the feature changes, including how to create and join communities. **To use the new features, you'll also need to re-download the Chrome extension** (instructions in the linked overview document, should take <5 minutes).  We envision that this community update will allow you to create communities for your project group, your personal archive, other classes, research labs, or any other scenario that you find helpful!  And as always, if you run into any bugs or have any suggestions, please let me know.  Thanks, Kevin

MP2.1 Access Issue Hi All, I am trying to access MP2.1 google link and running into issues. Can someone verify what they did to access it. ThanksI did.  There were a few things, like making sure that I had liked my google account to my Illinois account, etc.  I then set up the VPN.  For some reason I couldn't do this on my ubuntu box, but it worked just fine on Windows.  I have been playing with it.  Where are you stuck?  I run into the You need access google doc page. I tried with my google as well as Illinois account. How do I setup VPN?  I connected to the VPN and hit the request access button, did you have to go through the same path and wait for access? Hey Syed,  To access the Google doc page, you do not need the VPN. Everyone with an Illinois email should have access. However, you may need to activate your Google Apps @ UIUC service: https://www.nuestraverdad.com/post/activating-google-apps-uiuc Thanks. This worked That was where I got stuck initially.  In order to access any of the google docs from Illinois, you have to link your account.    Maybe this helps: https://www.nuestraverdad.com/post/activating-google-apps-uiuc   Thanks I got it figured out using this
Q3 question Why is this false?![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-13%20at%209.07.04%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/7fe9f757-d315-4cb8-b119-777dc6eb3016/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-13%20at%209.07.04%20PM.png)You can take a look at this post #373 thanks, I understand now!

How could we check our output gives reasonable result? As title. Could anyone give some hints or suggestions? I think I already calculated the likelihood after the EM steps, but I wonder how I could reasonably check my outputs.  ThxI can suggest two ways to check: 1. Consider the range of log likelihood and check whether your output likelihood at each iteration satisfies or not.  2. Run multiple times and check whether it will converge most cases. (the abs diff of two continous likelihoods is decreasing) Yes, I think it will converge. Because I noticed in the problem statements it mentioned like first 5 topics are related to "Chicago", I am wondering if there are any available methods for us to know our results represent what kind of topic. You may need to output the words with high generation probabilities for each topic to get a sense of the corresponding topics.
Do we have MP4?  On the Course Deadlines overview in week1, it says we have MP4, but inside the grades the last MP is MP3.   Also, what would be the timeline for MP3? On the overview and grades, it says deadline is 10/23, in week 7, it says available from 10/17-12/31. We are currently unsure whether there will be a MP4. Please wait for relevant post if there will be.   MP3 is due on 10/23, after which you can still access but get late penalty.  But MP 3 is still not available. Can we have MP 3 relased earlier so that we have more time to work on. We don't want another MP. Please don't please. There will be a MP4. Hi Yuxiang, is MP4 going to be similar workload as MP3? It's hard to say. My feeling is that the workload of MP3 isn't large. The core is to understand PLSA, which is covered by the course content.   MP4 will require knowledge not from the course. You may need to get familiar with advanced NLP knowledge, but the coding shouldn't be hard.  How much percentage of grade would MP4 be accounted for? Thanks It hasn't been decided yet.  Will relevant information about "knowledge not from the course" be provided in a way that we can digest without knowing other NLP or machine learning techniques? It does not seem fair to have such an MP if it requires something that is considered advanced but not covered in this course.... I agree, especially when we are doing a technology review and have a project going on at the same time, and an upcoming exam as well. Sorry that I have mentioned MP4 in an informal way. For any detailed information, please wait for the formal announcement. If you have further request, feel free to make a post once MP4 is released. 
Probability of generating phrases using unigram LM You are given a vocabulary composed of only three words: "text," "mining," and "research." Below are the probabilities of two of these three words given by a unigram language model:  text: 0.4 mining: 0.2  What is the probability of generating the phrase "text mining research" using this unigram language model?  The answer to this question is 0, which I assume is because we are not provided the probability of the word "research".  However, for this question: You are given a vocabulary composed of only four words: "the," "computer," "science," and "technology." Below are the probabilities of three of these four words given by a unigram language model.  the: 0.4 computer: 0.1 science: 0.2  What is the probability of generating the phrase "the technology'?  The answer to this is 0.12, because we assume the word technology takes on the probability of 0.3 (since 1 - 0.4 - 0.1 - 0.2 is 0.3)?  There might be some logic I'm confused about. I am just unsure why the answer to the first question is 0 and the answer to the second is not 0 (since "technology" probability is not provided). Any clarification would be appreciated. Thanks!You can obtain the probability of "research" by inspection because it says the vocabulary only contains 3 words, and we know the probability for all words in the vocabulary must sum to 1.   The answer provided above for the Practice Quiz 4 question in incorrect.  Use the same technique you describe for the Quiz 4 question and you can determine the correct answer to the practice quiz. We are given that vocabulary composed of only **4** words: "the," "computer", "science",  "technology." Sum of probability of all the words in the vocabulary= 1  So probability of "technology" =  1- probability of ("the" ,"computer", "science") = 1- (0.4+0.1+0.2) = 0.3  Oh I see now, that was my mistake. Following the quiz 4 logic, should the answer to the first question really be 0.4 * 0.2 * 0.4? Yes, that's correct. The probability of “research” = 1 – P(“text”) - P(“mining”) = 1 – 0.4 – 0.2 = 0.4. So, the probability of generating the phrase “text mining research” = P(“text”) x P(“mining”) x P(“research”) = 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.4 = 0.032, not zero.
Is it possible to have MPs due on the same day of the week? I noticed MP1 is due on a Sunday, but subsequent ones are due on Saturdays.  In order to allow for better planning/preparation, could I request that MPs be due on the same day of the week (Sunday, for instance)?  Thanks.I agree. If MPs are all due on Sunday, it will be very helpful.  same here, and I think most students have full time job and can only spend most of the time on the homework on weekends, it would be more reasonable to have the deadline on Sunday Ok! They should all be due on Sunday. The due dates are subject to change as we haven’t released them. We will release MP2.1 next Monday. 
MP3 Coursera Grade Not Updating ![2022-10-25%20at%2003.38.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a9ff3a5f-d1ac-436d-bd41-aee25d2d7ad5/2022-10-25%20at%2003.38.png)  I know this question was asked twice, but conflicting answers were given for them. One (#1162) of the answers said as long as I have a one on the leaderboard, I will be fine. But the other (#855) said I need to further improve my code. Which one is correct?   My NetID: rw17 DataLab username: shanengysAs per my understanding, as you have one in leaderboard you are good. May be TAs can confirm that your submission is successful. Score 1 should be ok. 
Proposal peer review Are there instructions for the peer review?https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/1187
Wasn't able to start my exam  Hi, I wasn't able to start my exam with the proctor. Anybody can help?   The proctor key in the password several times but wasn't able to get me unlocked to the exam. Issue resolved after I logged out and logged in for a new proctor. 
1-hr for each quiz? Hi Professor and TAs, Interested to know if each quiz has a one-hour time limit.  Does it mean there will be two attempts, each taking one hour?  Thanks!  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/46ac8e58-b2bf-4373-b828-0129a9025a0d/image.png)Just basing off of the orientation quizzes. You should get an hour per attempt on the quiz, and I believe you can end it early if you finish. I'm not a TA though so maybe someone else can answer but that's what I'm expecting. I think the 1h is just an estimate and not a hard limit, I just took the quiz and there was no timer ticking. And yes it's two attempts. From Coursera - Syllabus Section :  **Quizzes**. Most weeks will include one for-credit quiz. You will have two attempts for each quiz, with your highest score used toward your final grade. Your top 10 quiz scores will be used to calculate your final grade (i.e., we will drop the two lowest quiz scores). It is an estimate of the time we need to finish the quiz so that Coursera can calculate the total approximate workload of each week based on this information.  Typically, you can complete one attempt in time much less than an hour (you can just consider 1 hr as the maximum time for an attempt) because the quizzes are short. As already mentioned by others, you will get two attempts.  Hi Harita, if I am unable to finish an attempt within an hour, will it be considered a failure? The 1 hr is just a time estimate entered on Coursera. I do not think we have set a time limit for a given attempt (I believe there is no timer that gets activated when you start the quiz).
Request Peer Review I do not see any assignment that need to be reviewed. Can I get some of the reviews please?Are you sure you accepted the link sent by email and switched to reviewer mode? Yes, I just accepted the link. There are nothing after I switched to reviewer mode. I think TA need to assign reviews manually? Make a request at https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/1187 to Kevin Ros (TA) Correct, they're assigned manually by TAs after you accept the reviewer role. i had to toggle the "author/reviewer" button once to see the submissions for peer review. the page is loaded as "author" by default, but my role is displayed as "reviewer". not sure why.
ProctorU Firefox Extension is down Heads up that the extension is currently broken, and they didn't alert me until I had already logged in to start the exam. The recommendation was to use Chrome, so that's what I did, for whatever that's worth.
File encoding for MP3 Testing with DBLP.txt at first generated this error message: ``` UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 630: character maps to <undefined> ``` Manual inspection shows that the data file does contain some unusual characters. Opening the file with UTF-8 encoding removed the error message, and did not create any issues with test.txt. However, the change seems to cause this LiveDataLab error: ``` 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this function ``` Has anyone else encountered this or a similar issue?yeah it was building with python 2.7 so I used io open and passed encoding like this. This cleared the unicode errors.   import io   with io.open(self.documents_path, encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as fh: Use io module and use its parameter to open the file. Version incompatibility Charles and Sri, thank you very much for calling out this incompatibility between Python 2.7 and 3.x. I had not realized previously that LiveDataLab's use of Python 2.7 could affect coding of file open.  
Output MP1 What is the expected output look like for MP1? I am not sure why testing on LiveDataLab failed.  Edit: Solved Now. I asked this question because I set up the LiveDataLab earlier last week. When I just submitted the MP1, there was no logs. #203 said that we need to reconnect again, which help to solve the problem. I think the test on LiveDataLab calls the tokens_lowercase function and compares the output with what is expected. +1 to the other message, it might also be helpful to ensure your stemming and trigrams have been instantiated correctly for your token stream. 
Significance test - write as float or read as float I can only write as string in a file in bm25.text and inl2.text. The avg_p are float numbers. When I am trying to read it and save in a list , I am getting an error while typecasting to float. We will have to convert the avg_p into float to run on the stats.ttest_rel() function , right ?  Is there a better way to read as float the avg_p and store in an an array/list. ?You can use numpy array to do that. like Create a numpy array:   result_inl2=np.array([],dtype='float') and put all your avg_p in it. You can do something like this For array conversion: ``` flt_avg_p = [float(x) for x in str_avg_p] ```  For reading from file you will need to process each line and then append to a new list like below: ``` inline = []  for line in file_read:   inline.append(float(line)) ``` i think it's easier if you run the two ranker in one test, and just append them into an array [ ] when you calculate them, instead of reading from the .txt Thank you !!
Exam 1 * Just double-check,  1. the exam 1 actually takes place in the Coursera in the week 7 session? 2. we still need to log into proctor U before the test? Thanks! Per the course academic calendar, exam 1 is available to be scheduled through ProctorU between: Mon., Oct 10, 9:00am CDT and Sun., Oct 16, 10:00pm CDT. The proctor will direct the students to take the exam on Coursera. All operational/technical information regarding the exam is available as reading in Coursera on week 7 [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/GlP57/how-to-schedule-and-take-the-exam).

Unable to submit MP2.1 Hello Professor and TAs, my MP2.1 submission is failing.

Indeed, we are still testing it and will release it a bit later after we finish the testing. We may also use an alternative way to collect content in MP2.1. For now, to avoid any confusion, we have tentatively locked MP2.1 (as well as many other future tasks) so that you can concentrate on learning the Week 1 materials and finishing MP1. 
MP 2.4 Question This might be a dumb question but I just want to understand the requirements for MP 2.4. Do we need to implement the function so that it will find the best values for k1, b, and k3? Or we just need to test it manually? I have made 19 submissions right now and the best overall score still looks horrible. Please see the response from TA below (I post my question to TA&Instructor only) :  "We just found a possible error in the uploaded faculty data set, which we think is causing low scores, and we plan to resolve it shortly. Moreover the 0.7 baseline is a bit outdated, as it refers to last year's baseline. So once the data set is updated, we will run a baseline and provide everyone with an update."  Hope it helps. Thanks for the update. I was concerned seeing the current leaderboard. Not sure why the baseline would use last year's faculty data since we generated an entirely new dataset. Thanks for letting me know Hi all, please refer to the pinned post on MP2.4, we've lowered the baseline score and updated the dataset. You should be able to score higher now. 
error with submission ('ERROR: ', AttributeError("'module' object has no attribute 'log2'",)) My feedback showed me this, how should I fix that?livedatalab does not support log2. try log(x,2) Thanks! python 2.7 is used by autograder and it does not support log2() .
metapy for python 3.9.x If anyone is feeling adventurous and using metapy for the course project, I found a fork of metapy that supports newer versions of python.  https://github.com/tajshaik24/metapy  I was able to install it and successfully run the MP2.4 project with it on python 3.9.12, Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS. I had to install cmake first.  ``` sudo apt-get install cmake ``` To install, you'll just need to add the latest commit sha onto your pip install command.  ``` pip install 'metapy @ git+https://github.com/tajshaik24/metapy@06380750eb20761de629563db826c3fab26458b6' ```  ``` (base) ➜  CS410_MP2.4_private git:(main) python search_eval.py config.toml Building or loading index...

MP 2.3 Has MP 2.3 been released?  I can't find anything about it anywhere.  Thanks!!It is available on Coursera. https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/026Fl/mp2-3 GitHub link: https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.3 LiveDataLab link: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/project/view/535442415 Yes. Week5 of coursera. On the GitHub page it says it is due this week. That must be inaccurate right, since MP2.2 is due this week. Just wanted to confirm In Coursera MP 2.3 is due next week.  I had the same question, but it pretty unambiguously says 9/25 on Coursera.
MP 2.3 grade incorrect in Coursera Hi,  I noticed my grade for MP 2.3 is still at a 70% from my initial submission with the correct equation implementation. I had later finished the significance.txt portion (before the due date for full credit), while livedatalab updated to a 1 score instead of 0.7 coursera still reflects that 0.7. Is this the case for anyone else? Do I need to be concerned or is the system just delayed by update?  Any thoughts on this would be great! Thank you.try use coursera to open the link again and make a minor change and push again  Similar problem here, I just get overdue. Same here. Completed with full score on livedatalab last weekend, but no score on Coursera. Apparently my github token expired so I had to go through the gymnastics of token/webhook/livedatalab linking etc. I've made some trivial changes and pushed a bunch of times but have low confidence at this point. Does anyone know how quickly grades are reflected on Coursera if successful?
E step self.topic_prob shape? What should be the shape of the self.topic_prob in the E step part of the MP?it should be `[self.number_of_documents, number_of_topics, self.vocabulary_size]`. see the original `plsa.py` line 178 for reference.
Different Compression Encoding I found the textbook seems to define the encoding methods differently from the slides. (Is it based on different unary encoding?)   For the quiz, TA Assma let me know we should use the one in the slides (Thank you!) But which one is the general convention we should follow? Or is it based on different use cases etc  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/280f623e-f6bd-4935-9271-ab9019e835a4/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/0ea13ab4-25da-4df9-8c78-b1fce7d3cdae/image.png)It seems to be use case specific. The size of the compressed outputs of these methods vary so that could be possible one criteria to be considered. This is a superficial difference due to the difference in unary coding where we could switch the roles of 0 and 1.  That is, a unary code can be either many 1's followed by a "0", or many 0's followed by a "1". In the slides, we used the former, whereas the book used the latter. In practice, the decoding algorithm would work in exactly the same way in both cases and the compression performance is also identical.  For all the quizzes and exam questions, please use the convention adopted in the lecture slides/videos. 
Ask for any insights in MP2.4? I am curious about how other classmates achieved good scores in MP2.4 and what they learned from this parameter tuning.  Are we allowed to share parameters, codes, or any insights here, as the deadline has already passed?My score is not that good, this is how I did it: 1. Choose the right ranker, it seems BM25 is the best out of them. 2. Parameters tuning, start from the default value, tuning one parameter at a time, start from large step, submit, check the result, increase/decrease the parameter according to the feedback. 3. I feel that there are several local maximums, if you find (or guess) the global maximum at the first time , you are lucky. I used Okapi BM25, as it seemed like a good starting point. I implemented a grid search algorithm, trying all combinations of   b = [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0]  k1 = [1.2, 1.24, 1.28, 1.32, 1.36, 1.4, 1.44, 1.48, 1.52, 1.56, 1.6, 1.64, 1.68, 1.72, 1.76, 1.8, 1.84, 1.88, 1.92, 1.96, 2.0]  k3 = [0.0, 50.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 350.0, 400.0, 450.0, 500.0, 550.0, 600.0, 650.0, 700.0, 750.0, 800.0, 850.0, 900.0, 950.0, 1000.0]  While waiting for this to run, I decided to submit by using Okapi BM25's default values of b = 0.75, k1 = 1.2, and k3 = 500. This beat the threshold.   I eventually got some hyperparameters that resulted in the highest nDCG. These parameters lead to slightly better results on the test data. Interesting, I did not beat the threshold by using default Okapi BM25 value. Thank you so much for your sharing! Thank you so much for your sharing! In retrospect, I found that I learned next to nothing from this. I suppose this MP was meant to be a demonstration in the fine-tuning of hyper-parameters? Though, as we are all data scientists, this is likely something we have all done multiple times in order to achieve best performance. This MP seemed like an unnecessary program after MP2.3. 
Tech Review Citations What citation format should be followed for our sources? MLA? If so, which version? APA?  Also, do we have to cite things we have learned from this and other classes? How would we do that? > What citation format should be followed for our sources? MLA? If so, which version? APA?  The citation format does not matter, you can use whatever you prefer.  > Also, do we have to cite things we have learned from this and other classes? How would we do that?  No, for the purpose of this tech review, you do not need to cite content that you've learned in class.  Is Wikipedia an acceptable source? Generally, I would avoid citing Wikipedia. Instead, you can begin with their references. 
calculate_likelihood Hello, I'm a little confused about what should we return for the function `calculate_likelihood`. From the problem description, we only need to "Append the calculated log-likelihood to self.likelihoods".when you call `calculate_likelihood`, you will calculate the current log-likelihood of the model (given the current probability matrices). this value (the current log-likelihood of the model) should get appended to `self.likelihoods` as you suggested. i'm not sure if a return value is strictly speaking necessary, but you will need some way to calculate the difference between the likelihood at the current step and the previous step, to see if you have converged (given parameter `epsilon`). for me, i did return the calculated likelihood and that made it simple, but you should just as easily be able to just use the `likelihoods` list to accomplish this As return type is not defined in the problem statement, you can decide what works for your implementation. I have returned the computed likelihood as I then calculate the diff between the current & computed likelihood to compare with epsilon value.  The function is to calculate the likelihood score of the model, and you can find the formula in the lecture. But the exacct value depends on how your implement your model.
The repo name for mp2.3 in GitHub? I donot know if any repo name works for mp2.3 in GitHub.  I have tried use mp23_private and mp2.3gy_private as name. But it doesn’t work. So I am wondering if I need use mp1’s existing repo mp1_private? Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks. I believe the correct name should be MP2.3_private I used MP2.3_CS410_private and it worked.  It seems that as long as you have MP2.3_private in the naming structure, you should be fine.  My webhook  was acting funny so I actually played with the naming of my repo.  I deleted my webhook url, saved it, switched pages and came back to try it again and that worked.  I'm not sure if something was cached when the first url was errored out but this worked for me.   Thanks. Will try today.  Thanks Thanks Thanks
e step what is e step supposed to do? i know the formula for e step given in lecture, but i am unable to figure out how that translates to the e step calculation here.Luckily, for the assignment we don't have to worry about the background portion of the e-step. That mean's we only need to focus on this formula (which you know from the lecture):  $$p(z_{dw} = j) = \frac{\pi_{dj}^{(n)}p^{(n)}(w | \theta_j)}{\sum_{j' = 1}^k \pi_{dj'}^{(n)}p^{(n)}(w | \theta_{j'})}$$  or, simplifying:  $$\begin{aligned} p(z_{dw} = j) &\propto \pi_{dj}^{(n)}p^{(n)}(w | \theta_j) \\ where \\ \sum_{j = 1}^kp(z_{dw} = j) &= 1 \end{aligned}$$  To describe the above formula in words: the probability of `z` being topic `j` given `d` and `w` is proportional to the document topic probability for `d` and `j` ($$p(z|d)$$ or $$\pi_{dj}$$ given `d` and `j`) times the topic word probability given `j` ($$p(w|j)$$ or $$p(w|\theta_j)$$)  we either get our $$\pi_{dj}$$ and $$p(w|\theta_j)$$ values from the m-step, or initially from our random initialization. from there, it may be helpful to think about what we would do to get the value for a single document, a single topic, a single word. well, then the answer would just be $$\pi_{dj} p(w|\theta_j)$$ (i am dropping the time superscript from here) given that `d`,`j`, and `w`.   #1132 is a great post to help visualize the e-step a little better for scaling beyond just the case of one document, one topic, one word. to be succinct, you are calculating $$p(z | w,d)$$ in the e-step. because of this, it may be helpful to think about what the dimensions of an array representation of this should be? what would a numpy array's "shape" be to hold these values? it may be helpful to think of the "brute force" solution to how you would construct these results. and finally, the last step would be to normalize.  i tried to answer the question directly without exposing too much of the answer. but please let me know if that wasn't clear enough, i am happy to discuss and clarify further
MP2.4 Update Hi all,  MP2.4 has been released and is available on LiveDataLab.   For the leaderboard, you should be able to see 5 columns: AP Score, Cranfield Score, Faculty Score, Overall Score, and Final Score. The first 3 columns are the NDCG@10 scores for the respective datasets. The overall score is calculated as per the MP2.4 READme ( 0.1* NDCG@10 on APNews + 0.3* NDCG@10 on Cranfield + 0.6* NDCG@10 on Faculty dataset). Finally, in order to score a 1 for the assignment, you will need to *beat*  the baseline overall score (*0.4170671141624618*). If your overall score is higher than the baseline, you should see a 1 here and a 100% on Coursera.   Thanks for your patience and good luck on the MP!

Question about MP2.3 ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1ceacf29-e42f-48cc-b262-c64ab0c6f0f5/image.png) When I want to index the data by using the give code in MP Instruction. It has a runtime error that: RuntimeError: config.toml could not be opened for parsing.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6b24610c-788a-4b0a-97af-b2c2f82b7468/image.png) Also, I don't know why some part of original code is unreachable? Is that a problem? Thanks!For  RuntimeError, can check if config.toml is present in the same folder as search_eval.py Yes, they are in the same folder. I think it’s because the system cannot locate config.toml.  Try typing “cd Desktop\2022_fall\CS_410\MP2_private” on the terminal you already opened on VSCode and rerun the code.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9d1ba500-51fb-462c-8a69-8a59b290bdc4/image.png)  My vs code also shows me that region of code is unreachable when in fact it is and actually does run. Not too sure how to fix that The issue with pylance is that it assumes a context manager (the with statement) does not catch exceptions by default, which makes the code after it appear unreachable even though it is not. https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/773  You can wrap the context manager in a try-except block to fix it ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b6845022-127c-4a06-b323-1828028c8ac9/image.png)  However, this fix is purely cosmetic and your code should run regardless.     For the runtime error, you need to run python from the same directory as ```search_eval.py```. You can use ```pwd``` to print the current working directory. Use ```cd Desktop\2022_fall\CS_410\MP2_private``` to change it
Calculate likelihood with Laplace smoothing It's about the 8th question in practice quiz 11, how to calculate in specific? Why is 1/10 * 3/10? Thanks!$$d_{3} = (w_{3}, w_{4}) $$. $$p(d_{3}|\theta_{1}) = p(w_{3}|\theta_{1})p(w_{4}|\theta_{1})$$. To calculate $$p(w_{3}|\theta_{1})$$, we use the Laplace smoothing formula given in the question. $$p(w_{3}|\theta_{1}) = \frac{c(w_{3}, T_1)+1}{|T_1| + |V|}$$. We know that the $$c(w_{3}, T_1)$$ = 2. $$|T_1| = 6$$ (number of terms in $$T_1$$), and $$|V|$$ is 4 (total number of unique terms in vocabulary in the training data). So we get 3/10. Similarly, if we substitute the values, we can get 1/10 for $$p(w_{4}|\theta_{1})$$.
Git push mirror step stuck for very long - MP3    Hi everyone ,  My git push mirror step is stuck for a very long time. Do any of you have ideas on how to fix this? My internet connection is fine, and I am following exact steps in the MP set up guide as I’ve always done.  I really appreciate any help. Thank you. I had the same issue last night. I just restarted the terminal and pushed it again, and it worked. That worked for me, thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

Peer review instructions Hi everyone,  If you made a CMT account, you should have received an email inviting you to be a reviewer. **Please accept by clicking the link ASAP.**  Once you do this, I can assign you 2-3 project proposals to review. To view the proposals to review, you'll need to switch your role to "Reviewer" at the top of the CMT console. The instructions (questions that you'll answer) are on CMT.   During this time, the TAs will also go through all submissions and provide a "meta-review" with any additional feedback as well as enter grades on Coursera. Of course, we recognize that peer review grades may be inconsistent or unfair at times, so we will do our best to ensure that your Coursera grade is as accurate as possible. We will update you once all of the submissions are graded.   Thanks, Kevin

Zipf's Law with inverted index ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b68a0f5a-ea84-4000-817a-0e1161d35e2e/image.png)  Hi there, may I ask why we say "Exploit Zipf’s law to avoid touching many documents not matching any query term"? How do we achieve this for the fast search? Which step utilizes Zipf’s law? And how do we do that?Hey Yang; I also discussed this in #135 for further analysis to summarize, when you are compressing d-gap numbers there you are storing the differences of numbers so you expect those to be small for terms that occur in a lot of documents (since d-gap points to the "consecutive" relevant document) and in rare cases you will get large d-gap for rare terms. since it is for rare terms, you can handle a few large numbers. this is what i discuss primarily in my second response to Jeremy's question once i properly understood the question  please let me know if this and the referenced answer help, i am happy to discuss further
MP2.1 and MP2.2 Updates Hi all,  First, thank you for completing MP2.1! We've collected over 3,000 unique webpages related to CS410, all of which are searchable via [the CS410 search engine!](http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000/)  I've just batch-uploaded the grades for M2.1 to Coursera. If your grade is missing, please let me know, as it is possible that I may have missed something.   I've also just pushed the UI changes for MP2.2. The directions can be found [here on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/KGkqH/mp2-2). Please read them carefully before doing the assignment!  Finally, unrelated to the MPs, I've added a bit more functionality to the Chrome extension. Now, when you open it on a webpage, it will tell you (1) how other users have described the page, if any, and (2) if there is highlighted text, it will search the DL using the highlighted text as a query and show results in the extension itself. To view these changes, you'll need to redownload the Chrome extension from Google Drive.  Thank you for your patience, and good luck on MP2.2!  Best, Kevin
where do we define "number_of_topics"? assuming 2 (chicago vs seattle) for the test file, but can't see where/how it was defined otherwise...The number of topics is explicitly set in the main function at the bottom of the code. It gets passed in as a parameter to the plsa method omg - being super silly here. can just drop and die lol I think the number of topics is a hidden variable which we usually don't know, but for the MP it is set.  i think it's actually a good question - i'm not sure. if they are not that will be great, or we have an other dimension to optimize.
Quiz 2 Concepts Understanding  I just wanted to make sure my understanding was correct.  Question 2) Originally the answer is 1000 because we have to use the highest doc frequency query word since the question is asking for the minimum number of accumulators for the query. Now if it asked for the maximum number would it be 1100 because you would have to add all the query word doc frequencies?  Question 10) If the question asked for IDF weighting instead would the answer be "computer", because that would appear infrequently compared to "baseball" which would be a more common word if we are looking a term vector for a baseball sports news article?  Seems right to me
PLSA EM Algorithm Hi everyone,  Could anyone show me the normalizer for the probability of the background hidden variable? And its derivation? Thanks!   ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-20%20at%2012.10.04%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/edc500f7-4fc1-4e8a-829e-6246f174b186/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-20%20at%2012.10.04%20AM.png)  Let us try to think about what components will be present in the normalizer. If we are normalizing $$\lambda_{B}p(w|\theta_{B})$$, then $$\lambda_{B}p(w|\theta_{B})$$ should definitely be present in the normalizer as well, right? So now we have have part of the normalizer, i.e, $$\lambda_{B}p(w|\theta_{B})$$. What would be the other part? It would be something multiplied by $$(1-\lambda_{B})$$. This "something" would be the sum of all the ways of generating the word if the background was not chosen, i.e., $$\sum_{j=1}^{k}\pi_{d,j}^{(n)}p^{(n)}(w|\theta_{j})$$. So, the normalizer will be $$\lambda_{B}p(w|\theta_{B}) + (1-\lambda_{B})\sum_{j=1}^{k}\pi_{d,j}^{(n)}p^{(n)}(w|\theta_{j})$$ Thank you so much for your detailed answer, Harita! However, the formula has been presented on a previous slide. The professor indicated that this normalizer is a constraint about p(z = B). I guess that the constraint should be expressed in terms of p(z = j) and p(z = B). Do you think if it is possible? Hi Harita. If we plug the normalized p(z = B) and p(z = j) into the normalizer that you derived above, it will be p(z = B) + (1 - lambda) * sum(p(z =j)) = 1. Since sum(p(z = j)) = 1, we can obtain the normalized p(z = B) should be always equal to lambda. If this is correct, the normalization for p(z = B) will be very convenient. However, I don’t think that it makes sense. Can you confirm it? Thanks! I'm not sure how to interpret your question here, but as Harita has already explained, the normalizer for computing p(z=B) is λB​p(w∣θB​)+(1−λB​)∑j=1k​πd,j(n)​p(n)(w∣θj​). Note that in this case, the alternative (when z is not B) is all other (non-background) topics. That is, you should think about is the constraint : p(z=B)+ p(z=NotB)=1. One potential source of confusion is that according to our assumption (i.e., the two-step decision, first decide whether to use B and then decide which of the k topics to use), p(Z=B)+p(Z=theta1)+....p(Z=thetaK) doesn't sum to 1. Instead, p(Z=theta1)+...p(Z=thetaK)=1.  Does this make sense?   Note that the normalizer is not equal to 1. This is precisely the reason why we need to divide each individual estimated event count by the normalizer. If the normalizer were 1.0, we would not need to do this kind of division.  Hi Professor Zhai. I feel privileged that you can respond to my question! I greatly appreciate your detailed explanation, which offer me a deeper understanding. But I am still wondering if there is relation between p(z = NotB) and p(z = theta_j), where j = 1, ..., k. Do you think if the relation can be established? Thank you so much for your help!
CS 410 DL - Unable to specify video time Hello,  I am trying to capture a youtube video from a specific time but could not get it to work properly. The link to the video is youtube.com/watch?v=rsxT4FfRBaM&t=443s, but when I check my submission, it seems like everything after the ampersand was omitted.   Does anyone else have the same issue with the extension?  Sean Hi Sean,  This is likely an issue on our end. The database is showing that the video URL is saved correctly, so please proceed with saving videos with timestamps. I'll look into fixing this error today.  Thanks for pointing this out! Update: I think I fixed it, as now clicking your submission directs me to timestamp 443 seconds. Please let me know if it doesn't work on your end! It's working now. Thank you!
MP2.4 low faculty score I cloned the MP 2.4 today and still see a low score for faculty.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6707d567-4c80-4349-86d0-efc2a9c074b7/image.png)  what do I need to do so that the score gets to correct value.This happened to me. Removing the "idx" folder helped. Check out this [post](https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/633) who had similar issue. thanks that worked.
scrap google search results Hi,  I'm trying to scrap google search results (together with some other popular online forums as well) for my team project, but I have a hard time to find the proper attributes/classes to get the reference link via the HTML source code using chrome "inspect" function. Is it normal such info is hidden? do i need to get an API for such project?   thanks.
Issue about MP submission Hi,  When I try to submit my MP, I received this from the log. Could anyone give me some hints or suggestions on how to fix this? I don't know why I fail to submit the MP. I followed the steps in the PDF. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6298c11e-bbb8-4318-a326-9293050ad08b/image.png)Hi, It shows up like that, but takes a few minutes to build. You should see more logs in a bit ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1b4fa796-f5c6-4b60-bae2-f1b1d1e1deea/image.png)This is my submission history, is it normal? Can you try again? You should see it turn green instead of red. As Priyanka mentioned, give it a try again and see if the issue is resolved. Good luck! OK, I will try it again. And BTW, how could I resubmit or 'try again'? I always use git push to merge my updated code to GitHub, is it the correct way? Yes, each update to the repository is a submission. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3eb793a1-e5b5-40c6-9cc8-80a3e9da3c59/image.png) Why I get this? I followed the setup pdf to set up my account. Could you please give me some hints or suggestions?
Where to find AP, Faculty Datasets and Config Files I am working on MP2.4, and have been testing my parameters using the Cranfield data set provided in MP2, but where can I find the AP and Faculty datasets to test on those as well? I don't think we get those datasets. If you want to see the performance, submit your code on LiveData. I just used the Cranfield set on my computer, and then mad multiple submissions to LiveDataLab to optimize my parameters for the other sets. Wow, that doesn't seem very fair to us, but thank you  Keep submitting... super effective 👍 (but no)
Final date for MP3 Late Submission Hello,   For those who have not submitted, what is the final date of submission for the MP3?  Thank you
Question about the print statement in main() So there are three print statements in main(): ``` print(corpus.vocabulary) print("Vocabulary size:" + str(len(corpus.vocabulary))) print("Number of documents:" + str(len(corpus.documents))) ``` But when the code is run, these three lines are not printed out. I'm not sure if that's normal, and should I worry about it?  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-21%20at%2011.08.19.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d2d173e5-8256-4a7a-8124-7f96608a0036/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-21%20at%2011.08.19.png) Was your build successful?  It seems grader doesn't show this information, you don't need to worry about it as long as the result is ok. Yes. From my experience with MPs, I suppose only the print statement inside the class will be printed. The main function will be different for the grader and therefore, the debugging statements in the main function will have no effect. Resolved? 
Optional Video Lectures - Week 10 Is it okay to leave the Optional videos from week 10 ? Does quiz have questions based out of the optional video ? Will Exams have content from these optional videos ?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a91a920f-4f33-47b5-a71a-1fd249fff213/image.png)I don't recall any of the optional lecture material in this course appearing on the quizzes. I believe it is also confirmed by the TAs that optional material won't appear on the exams, either. thank you ! . I watched those videos. They help understand Naïve Bayes Classifier in text categorization.  If your question is with respect to the exam, then yes you can leave the optional videos.  If your question is with respect to learning, then I would recommend you to go through them at least once. There is a reason why the professor chose to record these videos and made them available for students.
MP1 - What method can return variable like 'trigrams'? Hello,  I am trying MP1, learning metapy tutorial.  However, I can't see any example that unravels variable like trigrams with .items() method that returns token and count.  I am trying code like ``` trigrams = metapy.analyzers.NGramWordAnalyzer(3, tok) ``` but it throws following error. ``` AttributeError: 'metapy.metapy.analyzers.NGramWordAnalyzer' object has no attribute 'items' ```  Could you give me a little hint what kind of methoud should I use?  Thanks,There was a comment ``` (name the final call to ana.analyze as "trigrams") ``` to hint this issue.  I will change this issue to resolved.  Hope this help! Look at the example about how they make unigrams and bigrams. The process is very similar
MP2.3 Deadline extended to Oct 2 Given the number of requests we were getting for an extension, we have extended the deadline for MP2.3 to Oct 2. This extension should be reflected on Coursera.
Unchanging log likelihood Hello-  I'm having issues where my log likelihood and the values for each probability matrix are not changing after each iteration.  I've implemented the E and M step so that I'm updating each matrix according to the formulas given in the lecture, and I've calculated the log likelihood according to the formula specified in #988 .   One thing that was unclear to me was the normalization part - is it sufficient to compute the numerator of the formulas and then call the given `normalize()` function? Do we still have to normalize if we've implemented the denominator of the formulas (isn't that just normalization??)  Any insight is much appreciated - thanks for your help!You can use the provided normalize() function as long as you remember to normalize along the right axis based on the the array you are using it for. To answer your question, yes- if your numerators are implemented correctly, you can use the normalize function to have the denominator implemented across a given axis. If you have already implemented the denominators, you do not need the normalize function. You can see a response from the TA regarding this here: #1093  Marking this question as unresolved because i have the same question, and although I followed the formula specified in #988, my log values are unchanging between the first and second iteration.  It can be used in M step but not E step. Before using normalize() function, make sure you are clear about normalize over which dimension and how normalize() function works. 
course project for undergrad students Just to clarify, is the course project a requirement for undergrad students taking the three credit hour section?Yes, the course project is a requirement for every student in the class (including undergrad students taking the three credit hour section). 
Tech Review with different reference I am wondering if we can choose a topic from the provided sample topics ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yeKm8hJbyRGhiUDvZv9-S3Zzu5hDtET-O6Yeci-VPOs/edit?usp=sharing ) but use different reference.Yes, using a different reference is acceptable. 
Group Project and Technology review Hi,  Should the group for final project and technology review be the same group(same teammates), since someone might choose the 3 credit option which do not need to finish the tech review?  Thank you!I believe that the technology review is an independent assignment ![tech%20review.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ba62b629-7b2e-4696-95ff-578dfbb48c9d/tech%20review.png) please see screenshot of the orientation view and it shows that the tech review is in group. There seems to be an inconsistency between the course introduction video and the technology review information reading. The video seems to indicate that it can be done in groups, but the reading says, "The Technology Review should be completed individually.", doesn't mention groups, and refers to the "student" rather than "students". Could an instructor please provide some clarification? Please follow the reading on the Coursera website --> the technology review should be completed individually yes the tech review is an individual assignment! not done in groups Sorry for the inaccurate description about the technology review in the introduction video/slides. It's an independent assignment. I'll correct this mistake and update the introduction video and slides.  Thank you for your updated!
Coursera Score not updated for MP2.4 I got a 1, however the Grade in coursera still says 0%,. Any suggestions what I might be doing wrong?  BTW I also tried [this](https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/622) suggestion, but did not work for me  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8124177d-0131-4461-ae81-0a957a82abe4/image.png)It's synchronized. There might be some delay when transferring grades. 
MP2.1 issues Hi,  I noticed I cannot create an account following the instruction provided on Google Docs, and there is no MP2.1 project section on Livedatalab. Could anyone give some hints or suggestions?  ThanksYou'll have to be on the Illinois VPN in order to create an account - otherwise, you might find yourself clicking the "New Account" button and nothing will happen! You don't need Livedatalab for MP2.1. Just create an account and save at least 15 links related to the course. As another student answered, make sure you are on the VPN. Hi, MP2.1 assignment changed and is no longer a **Livedatalab**. You can refer to the new instructions here: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/FO1Ol/mp2-1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/FO1Ol/mp2-1).  OK, thanks for your explanation. I did use VPN this time, but it still doesn't work. the digital library was down earlier in the day. are you still having problems to create an account? Thanks for your following up. I completed MP2.1, I create an account at 23:00 pm successfully. Thanks again.
Spoiler alert Use `math.log2` will fail passing the grading since Python2.7 doesn't support it.Just used the Math.log(x, 2) in python 2.7 and the grader should be working properly. I have not looked at the MP so do not know if python 2.7 is mandatory or not. But 2.7 reached its end of life January 2020. Why use it? I think python 2.7 is still used in several operating systems.  I asked this question to a prof a while back.  Their response was 2.7 is not going anywhere quick.   Well yes, it's not, but there has been no official support for 2.7 since 2020 Jan so was just curious why use it altogether. Valid point.   Because Metapy is not supported in newer python version. For mac I think both 2.7 and 3.5 will work. For windows, 3.7 also works.  yeah I setup pyenv for 3.5 and used that. Thanks. This worked for me. Got 0.7 instantly!  so happy
Parameter of JM/DP smoothing & query likelihood function ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-17%20at%2010.14.15%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/df788603-ff4f-4973-8b67-439897306f23/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-17%20at%2010.14.15%20AM.png)  How do we come to the conclusion that $$a_d$$ in the general query likelihood function equal to $$lambda$$ for Jelinek-Mercer smoothing?In Query likelihood function, ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c2ece84f-9a09-4a10-a182-468bc3f4751e/image.png) is (probability of seen words)/ (probability of unseen word in document). The probability of unseen word  in JM smoothing is represented by ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b0ad32cf-727e-455d-87f2-f1f8c88c9bed/image.png) where lamda is the coefficient to control the amount of smoothing. So comparing these two help us equate lambda to ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/331be2ce-2c53-4ddd-a896-54e0d2588db5/image.png) as 1. Essentially they both are smoothing coefficients. In Lecture 4.4 slide 5, the high-level formula is a good reference for this. Alpha and Lambda are the weight of pseudo word count in collection LM. ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-19%20at%2009.36.34.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e757d8cc-2ae7-4043-8a2c-8984ef34e235/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-19%20at%2009.36.34.png)
Lecture 8.10 I am taking lecture 8.10. It talk about the simple case with one document and one topic. later in the slides, it talks about language model setup, why there is M theta.  What does M mean?  Why the sum of M theta will be 1? I am still confusing how the likelihood function will find the topic. ![simplest%20case.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3bdfd793-7d2c-4c28-91b7-02b134a8ce4b/simplest%20case.png) ![model%20setup.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/68206ecf-6f92-489a-b226-9009537b56cf/model%20setup.png)I believe `M` is the size of the vocabulary (note: one reason $$d = x_1...x_{|d|}$$ instead of $$d = x_1...x_M$$ is because we are not accounting for repeated words here, but for the vocabulary we are only counting unique words) Thus, $$\sum_{i=1}^M\theta_i=1$$, because when we sum the probabilities of words from the vocabulary in the document ($$\theta_i=p(w_i | \theta)$$) , at least following the general Maximum Likelihood estimator approach, we expect to get a perfect picture of how the document is made up. For a simple example, if our vocabulary is $$V = \{the, text, mining\}$$, and in the document "the" occurs 2/5 times, text occurs 2/5 times, and mining occurs 1/5 times, that makes sense, because they sum to 1. We wouldn't expect a new term that isn't in the vocabulary to appear and throw off that sum. We also wouldn't expect a term to show up 2/5 times and have higher probability than 2/5. This goes back to Lecture 4.2 (and 8.8) where we see that the maximum likelihood estimation of a unigram LM is just $$=\frac{c(w, d)}{|d|}$$ Finally, we can follow from there to the steps in the later slide of Lecture 8.10 where the Lagrange Multiplier is used to obtain the topic word distribution using this Maximum Likelihood estimation  Let me know if that made sense, I am happy to try to explain more clearly especially if you have specific follow up questions (or if I missed answering anything from your post) what does θi mean in θi=p(wi∣θ) For my understanding, we have documents and we want to find out the topics from these documents. I still cannot get the mechanism of the probabilistic model to find out the topic from the document? $$\theta_{i}$$ is just a shorthand representation for $$p(w_{i}|\theta)$$. We try to estimate the topic using the documents. If we use maximum likelihood estimation, the estimate of $$\theta$$ will be the value of $$\theta$$ that maximizes $$p(d|\theta)$$. We can use the Lagrange multiplier method to finally arrive at the value $$\theta_{i} = \frac{c(w_{i},d)}{|d|}$$ to be the optimal value for the parameters..
When will MP4 be released?  I saw the thread in https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/795 that we should expect an MP4, but haven't given any more details other than that.   Given the course schedules and deadlines on coursera, it shows that MP4 will be due in 2 weeks. Will MP4 be released some time this week?   ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-25%20at%2010.52.06%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/0a9e08a6-2ea0-4636-a674-45ad5f66a617/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-25%20at%2010.52.06%20AM.png)I think this is the old schedule, no?  If you look at the grades section on Coursera, it lists only up to MP3. I agree, this looks like an old schedule. The current grade breakup for MPs is 25% and all seems to be divided among the existing MPs(MP1- MP3).  I assume that if we end up having an MP4 we will be given enough time to complete it, so the schedule would be obsolete Yeah it seems like there is no MP4 for now. It is not listed under the grades section on coursera. Hopefully, they’ll offer it as extra credit or something.
Same topic here Our group plans to build a chatbot, any group share the similar interest or anyone has advice for this?  Thank you.Just a question which top of your chatbot will focus on
MP1 Content Hi there, I wonder whether we need to learn the lessons of Week 2 first to do the MP1. Is it sufficient to do MP1 with only the lessons of Week 1?MP1 includes a brief introductory Meta tutorial that covers requirements of the todo portion of the assignment. Also, the chapter 4 reading from week 1 is dedicated to Meta, so yes, I would say MP1 could be comfortably completed having only completed the week 1 material.
Will the MP2 be graded with regards to the submitted content Will 15 submissions guarantee the full score?I don't think so. I think we just need to submit 15 links  Do you have reliable information source  Yes, submitting 15 links will guarantee the full score.  Thanks for the confirmation! I'm guessing the TAs are not keen to read/watch 15 articles/videos X 400 students. :-)  But I tried to find interesting content, as that's what we're all going to be relying on as a group for future exercises, I imagine.
Piazza Hi everyone, I am new to UIUC and I have never used Piazza. I believe the professor and Onboarding Course mentioned using that platform but I do not see it listed anywhere.  Are we also using Piazza or just Campuswire and Slack for class communication?  Thanks!This class is using Campuswire not Piazza this semester. Awesome, thanks!
Reminder: GitHub Token for livedatalab Just a reminder, your github token that you use to link to the livedatalab may expire. Make sure you update the token before next MP. First delete the current linked accounts. Then you can regenerate a new token (set it to 90 days as least) and link again. 
Technology Review I just want to make sure that technology review is only for students who register 4-credit hours section. So, if I register 3-credit hour section, then I do not need to finish tech review right?That's what it mentions in the syllabus. Maybe TA's can confirm Yes that is correct.

wget won't work ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e8e87a99-1383-4d08-b91c-5fe1e6e27529/image.png)  When I execute this step: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/0519e3e5-29dc-44d8-9400-618e9fb617df/image.png)  And I have tried !wget or @wget, neither of it works. Hey! I was getting same error,  I downloaded the whole text file and I am not getting error calling that module. You need to just paste that link in browser and download the text file. Make sure your code can access it, while using that module in next line.   You are running wget CLI in the Python environment. Try call wget in the terminal instead. Thanks everyone. I think the MP1 should note that.  You don't need to install or use wget. Just copy and paste the link in that command to a new tab in your browser and you can download the documents easily   Hello Xin, wget is a linux command, and unfortunately it does not work at the Windows command line or within Python. However, it IS possible to run wget in Windows Powershell, which can be found on the Windows menu. Pasting the link into your browser, as Maahi and others recommend, is just as fast. I learned this only through experimentation, so I agree with you that it would be helpful if the assignments can advise where each command or step should be executed.  I think for python you need to import wget, for windows you need to use curl command. See #321 
MP2.1 Submission after 15 links does not update coursera Hi, I have submitted 15 links as instructions provided for MP2.1. Output on Grades shows no submission. How do we know if what we submitted is accepted or not? ThanksGrades will be uploaded by TAs https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/352 I cant find the campuswire post, but there is a post from Kevin saying that you just have to be sure that you have done 15 submissions.  That is all you have to do.  There is a counter now in the upper left hand corner of the "my submissions" page.  For me it looks like:  Search Results Search Again Your submissions  Total results: 19 Where is this counter?  Where is the "my submission" page you mentioned? Disregard this question.  Campus wire #365 has this answer.  
Whiteboard on Exam I see that we're allowed 2 scratch papers for the exam. Could we be allowed to use a whiteboard instead?  If so, can you explicitly list that under allowed resources on the exam rules in proctoru?   Thanks!yes, no problem. I added whiteboard as a permitted resource. Thank you!
MP1 - Jupyter Notebook For those of use who prefer to work in an interactive environment in lieu of terminal, I've transcribed the README from [https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP1](https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP1) into a Jupyter notebook:  [CS%20410%20-%20MP1.ipynb](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/fd2b76af-249b-48fe-b706-24bf85ce4992/CS%20410%20-%20MP1.ipynb)  Simply save the JSON-encoded file with the extension '.ipynb' (eliminate the '.txt' extension if saved as text file) and I believe it should work; let me know if you encounter issues.  If enough people find this useful, I'm happy to do the same on future MPs as they become unlocked...please upvote to indicate interest.    This is very helpful. Thank you! This helped a lot！ Wonder how do we make MP2.3 as .ipynb

Difficulty of connecting to LiveDataLab How difficult is it to connect a leaderboard competition to LiveDataLab? I think it would be feasible to do some sort of competition but I am not sure what process it would take to put on LiveDataLabI'm not sure, as it likely depends on the skill level of the group working to implement the leaderboard. But if I had to guess, if one has strong Python development skills and familiarity with Flask, Docker, and MongoDB, then it should be feasible. 
Practice Quiz 1 I am somewhat confused regarding the following two questions on the practice quiz (and have not yet tried the regular quiz):  8. How many syntactic structures can you identify in sentence “A man saw a boy with a telescope”?  a. 1 b. 2 c. 3  What do you mean by "syntactic structures"? Isn't "a man", "a boy", and "a telescope" noun phrases, "saw a boy" a verb phrase, and "with a telescope" a "prepositional phrase"? The answer is not 3. How does this work?  9. In VSM model, which of the following similarity/distance measures would be affected by document length?  a. L2 distance $$||v_1-v_2||_2$$ b. Cosine similarity $$cos(v_1,v_2)$$  I don't think these were discussed in the lecture. Wikipedia says Cosine similarity is independent of length, so I chose that, and it is correct. Why does L2 distance care about document length? What are the contents of $$v_1$$ and $$v_2$$ here? Counts of words?  8. was mentioned in lesson 1.1. "with a telescope" could be referring to the man or the boy.  9. I found this explanation for cosine similarity vs L2 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19410270/vector-space-model-cosine-similarity-vs-euclidean-distance  Please correct me if I'm wrong! What does "was mentioned in lesson 1.1. "with a telescope" could be referring to the man or the boy." have to do with the number of syntactic structures? I saw that in the lecture, but do not understand how it relates to anything. Jeremy, I also was confused by the phrase "syntactic structure" in this question. But I think here it refers to different ways to understand the sentence, such as "a man saw a boy who was holding a telescope" or "a man saw a boy by looking through a telescope". This ambiguity was mentioned briefly in the lecture. How many syntactic structures can you identify in sentence “A man saw a boy with a telescope”?  The way I understand: how many ways can you interpret this sentence? Two ways. A man with telescope or a boy with telescope.  Thank you. Thank you. I think the syntactic structure may means different ways of understanding this sentence.  For L2 distance please see screenshot![L2.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/75dd1c1a-2875-489f-8001-de6cabc9640a/L2.png)

Anyone else experiencing the same issue? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/83da3725-4775-4d07-a0a0-45bdadfd2efb/image.png)Maybe different regions block it?
Question of Q5 in Quiz3 Hey TAs,  I was working on quiz3 for week 3 - TR system evaluation. I have a question regarding the Q5 answer why a retrieval system **can not** have an F1 score of 0.75 and a precision of 0.5. Based on the definition of F1, as long as the beta could be bigger than $$\sqrt{2}$$, then this retrieval system will have an F1 of 0.75, with a precision of 0.5, and a reasonable recall. Any explanation will be great!  Thanks!`F1` specifically means `F-score` with `beta` set to 1. Following off Dave, since F1 has beta =1, that means R would have to be 1.5 for this to be possible  Gotcha! Thank you all for the explanation! Don-Thuan Le already said that R would have to be 1.5 for this to be possible, but here is a more detailed explanation of why:  We know that $$F_1=\frac{2*P*R}{P+R}$$.  Suppose $$F_1=0.75$$ and $$P=0.5$$. Then $$0.75 = \frac{2*0.5*R}{0.5+R}$$ So $$0.75 = \frac{R}{0.5+R}$$ So $$0.75*(0.5+R) = R$$ So $$\frac{3}{8}+0.75*R = R$$ So $$\frac{3}{8} = 0.25*R$$ So $$1.5=R$$  R is recall, which is the number of true positives divided by the total number of positives, or, in other words, the proportion of actually relevant documents returned by some text retrieval algorithm. It is impossible to return more relevant documents than there actually are, so this case is impossible.
Not receiving grade on Coursera I got 1 point on livedatalab but I had nothing on my Coursera. I have waited for like 15 minutes and tried unlinking my account and resubmitting again. May I ask how to fix this problem? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f6a19f18-b816-4a97-a984-84c0112bb36c/image.png)Same for me. Seems like this is a common issue. I've seen similar posts like [this one](https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/591). I have the same issue. Me too Same for me. Have any of these been resolved?

LiveDataLab unaccessible Hello, I am working on MP3 with last couple of implementations, and I just cannot access the livedatalab website. It continues to load the webpage(indefinitely) but doesn't work with several reloads.  And I got warning that the page is not responding. What should I do? Anyone else with this problem?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/31216ffc-93f1-4f03-9b19-487dec5cb0a9/image.png)Oh, no worries! It came back after 20~30 minutes!
Looking for project teammates in Pacific time zone Hi classmates!   Anyone on the west coast want to form a group for the final project?  I work full time and mostly will be doing coursework on weekends.   Please reach out on slack if you are interested :)   Thanks, Akshat AgarwalI just see your post. I just email you and hope it gets through.
MP2.1-submittion I have entered one link it looks good , but now if I add another link it does not looks okay. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/cc779ad7-37d1-485b-bb5d-b8bb757f31d5/image.png)   Can you please help with which box do i need to enter url and which box do i need to add caption ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/58a63864-6f6f-4f1e-a572-ae69aeca9db8/image.png)It is my understanding that you don't need enter url. Just fill out highlighted text and its explanation blanks, then submit to CS410 DL. That's all. Thanks , for clearing confusion. Nusrat, the URL is entered automatically. If, in your example, you highlight the blog title "Integer Compression" before clicking the "DL Extension" icon, then the phrase "Integer Compression" should appear above the first box, just after "Highlighted text:". (The first box remains empty, which was a little confusing at first, but words shown next to "Highlighted text:" actually are stored in the database.) For the second box ("this is useful because") it seems okay simply to type or paste your own answer, such as "explains step by step how to compute unary, gamma, and delta encoding".  I guess the next exercise will give an idea of how well this works for determining relevance.
Question regarding DP Smoothing In the lecture, it is said that,  1. mu is the count of the pseudo words inserted into the model 2. if mu is decreased p(w|D) will become closer to ML estimate.  Given, mu can range from [0 to infinity], it is safe to assume that for lower value fo mu i.e. when mu is less that 10 (for example), the p(w|D) will be close to ML estimate?  I ask give the range of mu is significant large.The first part of the coefficient of the DP equation = |d| / (|d| + mu), you can see when mu is decreasing, this part close to one. while the second part of the coefficient : mu / (|d| + mu) close to 0, so the final p(w|D) = c(w,d)/|d|, which is the ML estimate. mu ranges from 0 to infinity, the logic should be true to any value of the mu. As mu increases, P(w|D) should move towards collection. As already explained in the replies here, it's the two coefficients, |d|/(|d|+mu) and mu/(|d|+mu), that control how close the estimated p(w|D) using Dirichlet prior smoothing. In general, as you increase mu, you'd increase the weight on the collection language model, whereas reducing mu would make it closer to the ML estimate. Think about mu=0, it would put all the weight on the ML estimate (i.e., no smoothing).  Also, note that for any fixed mu, no matter how large it is, as we increase document length |d|, it would also cause the coefficient on the ML (|d|/(mu+|d|) to increase, causing the estimate to be closer to the ML estimate, which makes sense intuitively as it simply says that as we collect more data (longer documents), we'd trust the ML estimate based on the counts in the data more. If we let |d| approach infinity,  the estimate would become essentially the same as the ML estimate.   Thank you Professor. I just making making sure. Given it is the interpolation of ML estimator and language model, I was not sure if there was a pivot number that balance the two given the range is from 0 to infinity.
rm -rf Error For some reason, when I attempt to remove the old repo like stated on Step 9 of the MP instructions, I am getting an error. Here is the error: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/052ea8b8-d602-4488-ab57-96f4a7367e22/image.png)How can I solve this error? Can I just move on with the steps, or will this cause errors? You can use rmdir for Windows or just delete the folder manually. The step just declutters so it's more or less optional. In general, you're probably going to see a lot of Linux commands and for the most part you can easily find the Windows equivalent (another answer here says to use rmdir). It's likely going to be useful just to have a Linux environment to work in anyway. For example, you could have a Linux Subsystem through [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
name 'pytoml' is not defined error ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/727e1994-c100-4344-a89e-56ce92bf45ed/image.png)  Hi, anybody has the same issue when working on MP3.5 and how did you fix it?  so i'm using conda for python 3.5 environment. Everything was working fine when i use the same laptop for MP1. This time I have this name 'pytoml' is not defined error. I have no idea why.   I could import metapy, but I'm stuck at  ``` >>> with open('config.toml', 'r') as fin: ...         cfg_d = pytoml.load(fin) ```  I guess I have metapy pytoml installed correctly, otherwise i wouldn't have finished MP1 last time.  I tried to remove py35 environment from conda and recreate python3.5 in conda, uninstall and reinstall metapy pytoml -- unfortunately it still did not solve the issue.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8515a21b-d42a-4152-b36f-7c3416bca54f/image.png)   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ac49e459-cd28-4917-9701-8bfd1879207a/image.png)  Someone help me please.  Thank you!SiCheng, did you already 'import pytoml' in addition to 'import metapy'? I do not see it in your screen shots.  pytoml is it's own package so that last line meaty.pytoml isn't going to work.  But as David suggested, make sure you include "import pytoml" in your document ahead of using it. The README for the MP includes the import for metapy but not pytoml. I was hitting my head against the wall trying to figure out why it didn't work before I realized!
MP2.2 Confusion I am a bit confused as to what we are doing on Mp2.2. Are we searching topics and using our judgement to determine if the query results are relevant/not relevant to the class?Yes, as the lectures also mention we are making binary judgement. Relavence feedback needs user to provide explicit judgement. See below: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e4e805b6-a2c9-421d-a6f5-5c29be6cd8a3/image.png) Hope it helps! To add on to the answer, the judgment of relevance should be based on the query, not necessarily the class. For example, if your query is "explanation of k1 b in bm25", then you should mark as relevant results that explain the parameters k1 and b of the formula bm25. 
Webhook fail to connect I tried to connect to webhook by following the instruction and use git to  submit example.py to my github MP1_private repo. But I am not able to see any submission on LiveDataLab   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/80c1cea4-497a-4e6f-9cb0-4a1ec1d10c7c/image.png)What does your webhook config look like? It should look like this: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a9628592-db9d-4e5d-b985-b2e6bbd7fc69/image.png) Hi, my webhook config looks like this, but I am facing a similar issue Are you sure you are using: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger and not livelab? If not, please share an image of your config.  I am also having the same issue. I've included the photo of my configuration. It's the same as the one posted.  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%203.38.03%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/738170fa-bfc7-42ac-b56e-6e97f23a3085/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%203.38.03%20PM.png) With similar results as the original post: ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%203.39.04%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/7d94b303-e5a7-4662-af5d-67a3a9baef94/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%203.39.04%20PM.png) Can you try deleting the webhook and readding? Absolutely. Just did and got the same error. For reference the response I am getting is 401, Github account not found. I tried deleting and relinking my GitHub to my livedatalab but no luck. ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%203.50.00%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/24949113-a01b-4d80-b686-a9bc106a5ffd/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%203.50.00%20PM.png)![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%203.51.13%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/25784996-3e94-4ac6-bd60-067afa174a17/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%203.51.13%20PM.png) This probably means that your PAT key might not be right. Are you sure you are copying the full value? And it is not expired?   I have deleted your github account from our backend, can you try to relink it one more time?  I figured it out. The issue was my computer kept default capitalizing to GitHub.com I re-added the account with "github.com" all lower case and that solved the issue. Try re-adding your account on LiveDataLab making sure the host is github.com (all lowercase) this resolved my issue. And got my first successful post!![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%204.03.23%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/97a872ba-a571-4a64-821b-00b97086f3dd/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-03%20at%204.03.23%20PM.png) I solved this problem by re-adding my account on LiveDataLab and using the host name as github.com(lowercase). Hey, try checking if the webhook link that you provided is correct. I believe that it should be http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger. This happened to me too. I believed it was something wrong with copying and pasting on my computer. I solved it by typing the URL manually.
MP2.2  It seems all these search returns come from the same source,  are they considered one judgment or in this case, seven judgments?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3d2bbba5-efa6-4d94-ba16-93f70f71c31c/image.png)I think it gave me credit for each one.  Could you click on the 7 that seem the same and then 3 other judgments to see if the search engine accepts them as your total of 10 judgments?  I have hit submit with only 9 judgments and the search engine displayed an error. I think one "click" equals one judgement. For the same website different sections maybe highlighted. I think each icon count as one try. Just for safe, I submitted at least 10 links for each judgment.   A judgment would be selecting the radio button with the option (Relevant/Not Relevant) so in your case for the query you have given you have provided 7 judgment.

Submission of MP2 I just want to confirm that do we need to submit our MP2 to LiveDataLab? Beucase when I clicked the "Open Tool" on Coursera under Week3 Assignment that directed me to LiveDataLab, I could not find MP2 in Projects section.Hi, I believe it was mentioned in a few other posts as well that as long as you submit 15 responses to the Digital Library you will receive full credit. There is nothing to be done with LiveDataLab for MP2.1 You don't need to do anything about MP2.1 and MP2.2 on LiveDataLab. However, you need to submit MP2.3 and MP2.4 on LiveDataLab. Clarification on scope of MP2.1 by TA https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/359
MP2.3 In MP2.3, are we allowed to change the name of the function load_ranker? Also, are we allowed to add parameters to the load_ranker function? I'm not sure about the function name change but since I was able to add parameter to the load_ranker function and receive success in LiveDataLab it might be possible. Thanks!
Problem with MP1 submission Hey there,  I am having problems for submitting MP1, I followed the instructions in Coursera, but there are still some error in pushing the code to Live data labm, anyone can help? Thanks ![%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2022-08-28%20%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%889.19.22.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1e1fc0c5-33f5-45cd-9178-d8149dbb1de4/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2022-08-28%20%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%889.19.22.png)  Just found the answer, the link provided in instruction is wrong.

Feedback Mixture Model ![ymail-tmp-8509540692894373742.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b8c2344a-3e71-466a-9148-a8d592e23578/ymail-tmp-8509540692894373742.jpg) I don't understand when we are using the mixture model for feedback why we don't use theta T (in my version of the equation) for feedback.  Doesn't theta F contain all of the common words (a, the, etc)?  Thanks!!Could clarify what $$\theta_{T}$$ is here? I couldn't see  $$\theta_{T}$$ used on the lecture slides. It is just $$\theta$$ on the slides.  I just came up with the idea of $$\theta_T$$ because I wondered if that was the topic model we wanted to use for feedback. Thank you! Sorry, I did not understand. What is the difference between $$\theta$$ and your $$\theta_{T}$$? It seems that the $$\theta_F$$ model contains all of the common words like a, the, etc.  I don't understand how this is helpful if we combine all of these common words with the query model for feedback.  Shouldn't we combine the topic model with the query model to make the updated query model?  Thank you!! I got it now!!!  I just didn't understand the argmax operator.
MP1 vs MP1Project Hi, in my LiveDataLab, on the project overview, there is a "MP1" and "MP1Project". Just want to double confirm to be safe: we only need to complete MP1, and don't need to care about "MP1Project" - it's for the developer to test... right?![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/885c3159-ecde-449d-8288-cd81c1e320de/image.png)Yes, as per my understanding we need to complete MP1.
mp3 live data lab failure i've been trying to submit my MP. it runs fine locally, but immediately fails on livedatalab with no logs. any idea what could be the problem?  UPDATE: unfortunately, it kept failing. i got logs stating that there were errors on a certain line after updating my token but i have no clue what the problem is since my code runs accurately locally with no issues. is it possible for a staff member to look into this? im using the python version specified to use in MPs Have you tried #1249?  thank you! ill try that. its past the deadline, now but let me see if it works I've noticed it can take some time for the log to show up as it's big.

Issues with ProctorU Password I saw a post that some folks have had trouble with the ProctorU password for Exam 1.  Is this resolved or do the TAs recommend taking this exam on weekdays or earlier than the last date?   Considering that the ProctorU folks have to reach out to others for potential issues. Just asking since this is the first time I am using this service and I am scheduled to take the test on Sunday.I think now we can take the exam without any trouble.  I had trouble with the password for the first time, but when I reconnected with a new proctor later, she entered the correct password without any difficulty. So the problem we had at the beginning seems to be resolved now. Sounds good. If you have trouble the first time, can you reconnect/reassign to a new proctor the same day? Yep on the same day. I hope you have no trouble. Sounds good, thanks! I took the exam last night and I also experienced the password issue. My proctor failed 5 times and finally was able to figure out the correct one. I had to point out like 'you might have a wrong password' as he had no idea why it is not working!!  Sounds good, thanks for the info.
MP3 Grade on Coursera not showing up I got a success response on my latest push and grade shows as one on the leaderboard in LiveDataLab, am I missing something?I reduced the tolerance on my iteration, it completed in fewer steps, and now my grade shows up Although this didn't work for me, re-launching the assignment from Coursera and then again pushing to github did fix it for me. I did something similar by updating `epsilon` to a larger value in order to make it easy to converge. the 2nd attempt got my grade to show up. (although both attempts show "1" in the leaderboard) When we check for convergence, does that mean if our current log likelihood is <= epsilon then it has converged? Or is the case for >=? nevermind  May I ask what's the issue? 
LiveDataLab FAILURE without logs **SOLUTION:** I deleted the linked GitHub accounts from LiveDataLab, relinked GitHub to LiveDataLab and then it worked!  On LiveDataLab, I am getting FAILUE status, but my code is not actually running. I commented everything and kept only a 'Hello World' printing statement, that didn't show up either in the log.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/501e10b1-a0b3-45cd-b554-8cb7d4edc6db/image.png)!  - My GitHub Personal Access Token had expired. I created a new token from GitHub, relinked that to LivedataLab. - I deleted my GitHub repo and redid all the cloning and pushing steps from the start. - I reopened the LiveDataLab link from the Coursera 'Open Tool' link.  None of these helped.   My issue is similar to the following post. I tried the solutions mentioned in the replies of this post, but these are not working.  https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/1138. I also encountered the same problem. Kowshika, this is the error for your code:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e4d43f4c-ea8b-4d12-92fa-3cfc66f44715/image.png) Yijing, you are also getting the same error as above Thanks a lot for getting back, Priyanka. I later could see the logs after deleting the linked accounts from LiveDataLab and Coursera is also showing my grade for MP3 now. As Kowshika said, I relinked my GitHub account and it worked! I guess it is because I used a new GitHub token.
Please help on submission not going through on LiveDataLab Hi, I am trying to submit my assignments 2.3 and 2.4 but I am unable to on LiveDataLab. My webhook on github is detecting the pushes, but not directing submission to LiveDataLab.

Combined Slides for Each Week? Hi Professor and TAs, I would appreciate it if you could kindly upload weekly "combined slides" (or a single pdf for the entire class). This will be very useful for learning and reviewing.  Many thanks!I agree if that won't add too many burdens to the professor and TAs. What I followed is to download the course content using the https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl. This way I do not need to download the pdf's separately. Hi,  One challenge would be the size of the document and its organization? We currently have a way to download the slides for a particular week. It becomes easier to organize it so we can only differentiate and easily pick up the slides for that week.  If required you can also try appending the pdf using different tools available in the web. 
can someone help with MP1 i do not find clear instructions on MP I am completely lost . Can some one pelase help ?If you have problems with the MP setup, you may refer to this post #24   For the MP1, you only need to use some methods in **metapy** to define 2 variables. The github page (where the readme file will be shown by default) provides detailed instructions on how to use those metapy methods. You can start by following the instructions on Coursera. Once you git cloned the assignment, go though the README file, it has very detailed instructions.  The README file in the git repository should have all of the instructions for the MP. I had the same problem but realized the only way to see the project instructions is to follow the mp setup process and clone the git repo first. You won't see the lab instructions on Coursera or LiveDataLab. I converted the README to a Jupyter notebook, if that helps...check out [#128](https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/128) thanks All for helping :) thanks for helping.
MP1 Submission I managed to submit successfully, but the auto-grader does not provide me logs, even after waiting a while.  First Submission: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/04e64ffe-992f-4b94-87ac-8a03e989dc12/image.png)  Current time as of post: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/fd300e60-0bb5-470b-ba44-656f9d3257b9/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/bf5e38fe-44b2-4767-88e9-2c2832227355/image.png)  1. What should I do to resolve the issue with the logs not showing what happened?  2. Do we need to have the config.toml file as part of the submission (or if the auto-grader is looking for that file)?I got this error too!! So what I did was that I had to delete the linked account on livedatalabs and link it back again. I created a new authorization token as well. I then copied my code from my previous project, deleted that github repo,  made the repo again, and then linked it to the likedatalabs with the webhook again. I then pasted my old code and submitted it and I passed!! These instructions fixed my issue. Thanks.
practice quiz9- Q2 confused.  i think it should be (0.3x0.1+0.7x0.5)x(0.4x0.3+0.005x0.7)=0.0589The key to this question is this sentence in the directions "To generate a document, first, one of the two language models is chosen according to P(θi), and then all the words in the document are generated based on the chosen language model." In other words, draw $$\theta_i$$ first, then multiply by the probabilities of each word given $$\theta_i$$. There are two cases so will need to add these probabilities for each $$\theta_i$$  P("the technology") = P($$\theta_1$$)P("the"|$$\theta_1$$)P("technology"|$$\theta_1$$) + P($$\theta_2$$)P("the"|$$\theta_2$$)P("technology"|$$\theta_2$$) = (0.3x0.4x0.1) + (0.7x0.05x0.5)
some helpful visual if you just start the project - hope it will help. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f11e614d-2a40-4572-820c-b724ca3606f7/image.png)Thank you Jianci! I'm curious what's the data type of term_doc_matrix? Is it a 2d numpy array or is it a pandas dataframe? if 2d array, how do you add column headers to this matrix? For this project, we are all using matrix. I manually created the chart in excel  I know we’re using matrix, just as its name suggests… but how do you represent the the column header in term_doc_matrix?  The column heads are not required that’s why I usually create visual charts to help me think … as long as the order of ur variables don’t change, you will be able to calculate without column/row names …
Question in Practice Quiz 05 Hi,   In the practice quiz of week 05:  In PageRank, one needs to estimate the transition probability between pages. Which one of the following statements is true:  - The sum of probabilities of jumping from one page to all other pages is one - The probability of jumping to page A from page B is the same as that from page B to page A - The number of parameters in the transition matrix is smaller than the degree of freedom of the transition matrix  Could someone please help me understand why the 3rd option is incorrect?  Also for the 1st option, if a page has no outgoing links, should the sum of probabilities of jumping to other pages equal zero?  Thanks Degree of freedom can't be larger than the number of parameters because it's a measure of how many things are allowed to vary, you can't have 8 degrees of freedom when there's only 7 variables. PageRank also has random hopping, so that might be related to the second question? in addition to Robin's point about degrees of freedom, to more directly attempt to answer the second question:  in the case where a page has no outgoing links, it is probably safe to assume that the `Transition Matrix` probabilities of jumping to other nodes from that node (without random jumping) are 0, though maybe we could add a special case here where $$M_{i,j} where \ i == j$$ would be 1 for that node. However, with random jumping our probabilities from the original Transition Matrix plus the random Transition Matrix (which has uniform probabilities for all entries) get mixed together. In this way, we can still maintain that with random jumping the sum of the probabilities of jumping to other pages equals 1 (but they will all be from random jumps) thank you! thank you!
don't print output, or you may not pass I have used a lot of prints to debug .. then i found with print() I can't pass livedata and it keeps telling me I have errors in implementation... until I commented out those print... just FYI.Thank you that is really useful.

Which grades are final? Hi everyone,  Will the grades posted on Coursera for each quiz/assignment be the correct/final grades, or is there somewhere else we have to check our grades? Thank youI believe up until our final grades are posted on our Student Center profile, what we see in Coursera should be correct and "final". (TAs can probably confirm this) Your Coursera grades should be correct (please let us know if they are incorrect). The final grade that you get will be posted on self-service/myIllini, but for the individual assignment grades, you should use Coursera as reference.
Project team size How to find out what's the workload and plan the size of the team. Does it matter if we plan to have 5 people in the team, only to find out that 20*5 worktime is not required or we need more time(in case we have 3 members). Is there any team size that's suggested based on the project (1-5) topic?> How to find out what's the workload and plan the size of the team  We ask that you provide your best estimate. There is no way to know for sure. Ideally, you can design the project in a way where the workload is flexible. For example, in the proposal, you can write something like "If we have additional time, we will add X and Y".  > Is there any team size that's suggested based on the project (1-5) topic?  No, there isn't. It depends more on your specific project than the topic. 
Signing Up For Exam 1 Is it called "CS 410 - DSO- Exam 1 FA22" (I am in the DSO section, with a CRN of 67393)? When are we supposed to sign up?Yes, I have signed up for this section.  Can TAs pls confirm Hi, it's better to wait for the formal anouncement of exam registration.  Based on my experience with other courses, sometimes the link will be changed, then we have to sign up again. I also signed up for the same session, is it still valid?  you can signup now!
Now that everyone is finished with MP2.2 I am curious to see the parameters in which each of you determined relevancy. As relevancy was a binary choice, I found choosing relevancy of a document to be sometimes difficult. Some results would have partial information on what I was querying for but missing the general point of the question. For example, in a search for "Jobs in SEO", a Wikipedia article telling me about Google SEO is related, but not entirely what I was looking for.   Thank you,  DillonI think the answer really depends on what the user is looking for to find. If he is looking for a particular answer to his query where the result to be expected is just one document then in the above case, he would categorize the document as not relevant, but in other cases, where the user is just browsing as discussed in the lecture videos, the user could categorize it as relevant. I think starting with a particular idea in mind before querying would help us better decide whether the query is relevant or not relevant. I believe there is no right or wrong answer here and that it is really dependent on the user, what may be relevant to one user might not be relevant to the other as discussed by the Professor in the lecture videos as well. The usefulness or relevancy of each document with respect to a query should vary on users' implicit intention. This is why, e.g., the search engine algorithm gets feedback on the click-through rate. Clicks on the link is a good estimator of relevancy, and the click-through rate is not a binary but a continuous variable. You have a valid point. I believe others would have had a similar experience. In addition, we were also restricted to only 50 searches on the page (if I am not mistaken). I feel there could be more relevant document that could have not returned in the search and were missed since we were not able to click on the next page. To your point, we have covered multi level judgement in the class which could be helpful in understanding the true relevance of a document.  Having said that, I believe the intent of the assignment is for students to get familiarized with the concepts and hence would have been presented with the binary choice instead of multi level judgement to reduce the complexity.  It would be interesting to see how the MAP changed over time. Like others have said, relevancy is subjective based upon the expectation of the users. For me, I determined relevancy based upon whether I felt that the resource sufficiently resolved my question, e.g., was it sufficient to explain a concept or help me in a code implementation, or at least refine my understanding to the point where I could go back to submit a more appropriate query. Resources that simply regurgitated my query terms but didn't further help develop my understanding I marked as non-relevant. For example, I was surprised at how many people submitted the Coursera syllabus or weekly overview pages as resources. I don't understand how those could be thought of as having reasonable utility. They simply state terms and concepts and aren't even a true hub page with outlinks. I marked all of those results as non-relevant.
MP1 Tip: Webhook for LiveDataLab  Everytime I try to add webhook to my github it always shows sending ping failed to the address I copy pasted from mp setup.docx.   I just noticed if you copy paste directly from the document the web url is wrong  **http://livelab**.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger  Correct one is below:  **http://livedatalab**.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger  Hope this helps. 
MP2.3 Coursera Grade Not Updating Hi everyone,  I submitted MP2.3 a few times on the LiveDataLab and finally got a score of 1. However, my grade on Coursera doesn't update and still shows "30%" as the grade I got at the first time. Does anyone know what is going on? Thank you!    ![grade_question.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9ee0fae6-f8a2-4d0e-b3f9-db5de2fa9d2d/grade_question.png)I got 1 on livedatalab but 0% on coursera.. I saw a answer in another post(which I connot find anymore) says the TA says there is an error in Coursera system and they are working on updating, Just wondering where can i see the score? I saw "SUCCESS" in my submission but I don't see any score/grading. Cousera doesnt have grading either.  Click "Leaderboard" on the left of the Submission History page. The score will then show up. Thanks for the answer! I also cannot find the post. I might contact TA later if my score has not been updated. Hi i'm facing the same issue as well. Have you got any replies from TAs yet or can you share the TAs contact info? Thanks! login to livedatalab one more time and submit your code again. This method works for me. Hi, I followed the tip on #659 and succesfully renewed my grade on Coursera. Resolved. Thank you!
Questions in Practice Quiz 06 Hi All,   I have 2 questions in Practice Quiz 06:  ##### Which of the following tasks can be solved as a classification problem? I'm not sure why the option "Ranking" can also be considered as a classification problem, doesn't rank always requires a non-binary value to rank?  ##### When a new user comes, which of the following will NOT help for recommendation? - Ask user to first select a few items that he likes - Ask user to provide a short description of himself - Recommend user with random selected items  I was wondering why option C won't help? Since the user might be able to select a few of those randomly given items, then the recommendation system can implicitly learn the user's preferences from it to improve the recommendation system.  I was wondering if anyone can help me to understand them?  Thank you so much For ranking: First, I'll say that classification problems don't necessarily have to be binary. Classifying a picture as being a dog, cat, or bird is also classification (in this case, 3 classes).  However, in Lecture 6.2 `Learning to Rank -- Part 2`, we see a Logistic Regression approach to ranking. In this approach (which is also hinted at in lecture 6.1), we do classify documents as "Relevant" or "Not Relevant" and can rank them based on this, for example by their probability of being relevant.  For the second question mentioned, I think you have to take each of these 3 options at face value. Will `Ask user to first select a few items that he likes` help for recommendations by itself? Yes, it will allow us to leverage content-based filtering to determine what the user likes. Will `ask user to provide a short description of himself` help for ranking by itself? Yes, we can use this description to see how similar the user is to other users in a collaborative ranking type approach. Will `Recommend user with random selected items` help by itself? No, we would need to pair it with some other strategy, like allowing the user to rank the randomly provided options. Since this option does not mention allowing the user to rank those options, we should assume that we are only presenting random items to a user here, which will not help recommendations. While the other two options explicitly provide us with user input to either compare that user to other users or compare content that user likes to other content, the third answer does not give us any information about the user and is just the action of presenting random recommendations.  I'll mark your question as unresolved in case others can think of more to add here, but let me know if that made sense or if I can clarify further

The first field in the "Create Account" section is meant for the email, but the second field is meant for your username (which is supposed to be your NetID). So when signing up, please change your second email to your NetID. 2. Have you downloaded and started the VPN, as described in the overview document? thanks kevin, it worked for me :)  Great! Glad it works We should include this info at the first place. I bet a lot of people don't know about this Hi Kevin, unfortunately I am still running into issues and could use some assistance. I am getting access issues for the "sign up sheet" still, and I have followed the directions activating my google account (when I logged onto it it was already on), as well as tried access both with and without VPN. I am unsure where to go from here, if I could get some guidance that would be great! Thank you.  I finally can access Google doc with my linked account through private mode of chrome You do not need to access the sign-up sheet. The only documents that you need to access are listed in the MP2.1 description on Campuswire.

It's already answered here #352. Also, can refer the below discussions for further details of M2.1  https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/359 https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/354  So this one becomes obsolete????? https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.1 I spent at least 5 hours on this assignment and you guys just changed the assignment for no reason.... Probably the course staff can comment on this. If you want you can change the status to Unresolved. I'm just your fellow classmate, trying to guide you where you can see the latest MP. :) Hi Jay,  My apologies for the misunderstanding on MP2.1. We tried to make it clear with Campuswire posts +  locking the Coursera assignment description that it would be changing from the previous year. We're also in the process of removing the old assignments from Github and LiveDataLab, which will hopefully prevent future misunderstandings.  We made the changes to MP2.1 and MP2.2 so that the students' efforts towards completing the assignments would build something that brings benefit to the entire class (i.e., a searchable collection of useful webpages related to the class). Additionally, the overhead for completing MP2.1 is lower than the previous version (e.g., no coding is required). We hope that the increased benefit and lower overhead offers some consolation.   Again, sorry for the confusion!
Proposal Submission showed over due  Hi,      I submitted the Project Proposal to github and added the link to CMT. But today I saw the "over due" in Coursera. Is it a correct status? and when will we have the grade usually? Any idea? Thanks.   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3e4c703a-a758-4a5b-a7bb-e87cab476b9e/image.png)Yes, this is correct. The grade will be entered after the peer review phase.  Thank you.

Issue installing metapy How can I fix this error?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c03a3de5-0ed2-4ab6-bbf5-c98c45d8bf2d/image.png)From the error log , it looks like you are missing cmake executable. You have anaconda installed so try to install cmake via Conda https://anaconda.org/anaconda/cmake   See #34 Also you can see explanations givens in #28  Even I was unable to get metapy to install correctly on my computer. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy works natively there. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153  
Group project achievable with one person? Hello,  I just wanted to ask and see if the group project is achievable with one person?  I do find the group coordination to be quite interesting as I haven't seen that in other courses before!  Thanks!Yes, it is certainly possible to do the final project independently. But we do encourage students to work in groups! Thank you for your response! I will definitely consider group work too!

Metapy Documentation? Is there a list of documentation for what the various functions in Metapy do? I looked in the github repository, and while there are some tutorials, I did not find a place that listed all the functions and what they did.  I am currently somewhat confused about PennTreebankNormalizer, default-unigram-chain, default-chain, ptb-normalizer, how toml files work, and what the tree stuff produced by the final code block in the README is about (though I finished the MP).Is this what you are looking for? https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/namespaces.html You may have already known, but there are also many tutorials at https://meta-toolkit.org/

I pass this one and my log is showing the information about Python version as well. You may want to focus on what is under "Traceback (most recent call last):".  The "TraceBack" says that that's the problem of mp1_grader instead of my code... How to use this instruction to find the corresponding code What is your netid? hc56@illinois.edu Seems the test_tokenizer.post_results() problem... Can not debug further...

Lecture 2.1: IDF Hi, Are these IDF values calculated based on the example sentences literally or just some numbers to make a point? Thanks! ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-26%20at%2010.59.55.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d19fc28d-57d2-4a35-82c6-96ffaf2b1e54/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-26%20at%2010.59.55.png)IDF values seem to be indicative of the logic being explained. If it helps, a similar post is answered at [](url)https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/96 thanks a lot, saw that post but want to get confirmation from TA Yes, as some of you have already explained, the IDF values here are meant to illustrate the idea behind IDF; they aren't the exact values of IDF that we'd obtain if we were to use this toy data set. Thanks to all of you for the timely answers to the question here and a similar question in another post! 
Office hours going over the quizzes? Hi, I wonder are there any recordings of office hours that go over how to solve the quizzes' questions? Would help a lot for learning. Thanks!So far, my office hours have been mostly used for discussing some issues with MPs and project ideas. If there is any critical elaboration of any concept or quiz question beyond what the lectures have covered or the responses already posted on Campuswire, we will post the explanation/elaboration here on Campuswire, so that  those of you who didn't visit the office hour would also be able to see it.  Note that we generally wouldn't discuss test quiz questions publicly or with anyone who hasn't taken it yet. Such discussion, however, can be done with a "private" note posted by the student to the TA and instructor on Campuswire. For example, if you feel a question in a test quiz is ambiguous,  you should post a private note to ask us to clarify. Of course, you should feel free, indeed are encouraged, to discuss any *practice* quiz questions here on Campuswire or any concept covered in a test quiz without referring to the specific question in the test quiz. 
Example Tech Review Hi, maybe I missed it but could we by any chance get an example tech review? I know the general structure is intro, body, conclusion but it would be helpful to see previous student submissions just to see good examples of what the instructors are looking for.I don't know if any example reviews will be provided, but the instructions are pretty open-ended so as long your review meets the general requirements it should be fine. Yes example tech reviews would be very useful. The instructions for this are in week 8 right? Apart from this, are there any other specific instructions we have to follow? Hi I know I'm a little late to this one. But I found this github page of a past student https://github.com/raman162/cs410-tech-review/blob/master/techreview.pdf
Gamma and delta encoding ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/182186c4-0ca8-41e8-ada9-9a2a29b09950/image.png)  Hi, can someone walk me through how in gamma encoding 3 is 101, and in delta encoding 3 is 1001? Having a hard time figuring out to calculate these.see #301 Here are step-by-step calculations. I hope this will be helpful. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/306f7555-bce6-47fc-a79e-c12c233a3e92/image.png) You can easily (inverse) gamma encode without the floor or log functions.  **Encode** - Convert the number to binary:    - $$3 \to 11$$ - Create a unary prefix equal in length to the binary encoding.     - The binary encoding is length n = 2, so this means (n - 1) 1's followed by a 0   -  The prefix is $$10$$ - Drop the leading 1 from the binary encoding and attach the prefix for the gamma code:   - $$10|1 \to 101$$  **Decode** - Drop the unary prefix, which is everything up to and including the first 0   - $$101 \to 10|1 \to 1$$ - Prepend a 1   - $$1|1 \to 11$$ - Decode the binary   - $$11 \to 3$$
Q2 from Practice Quiz 6 Can anyone help as to how Ranking is considered as a classification problem. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d81444ed-4a05-4772-9a21-2d765e945f4f/image.png)#816 If you are familiar with ML methods, think of ranking as a multiclass problem using the softmax function to return the "rank 1" class among k possible outcome classes.    In this context, the k possible outcomes are the ranks (i.e. 1 to 10) and instead of returning the top probability, i.e. softargmax, you return the full ordered list of probability rankings.  Thanks, this makes sense. Thanks for the pointer.
Lesson 4.1, 4.2 & 4.3 Hello,  After I take Lesson 4.1-4.3, I am still confusing about probabilistic retrival model, language model and query likelihood retrieval function. Can anyone explain the relationship among these model and functions?   In addition, is the query likelihood function a ranking function to rank the documents based on a specific query?  Thank you!In my understanding, probabilistic retrival model is a ranking function, but it has many specific forms. You can implement a probabilistic retrival model through the language model technique. One specific implementation of language model is query likelihood retrieval function. In other words, query likelihood retrieval function is a kind of probabilistic retrival model through the language model techinique.  So, yeah, the query likelihood function is a concrete ranking function to rank the documents based on a specific query.  Probabilistic retrieval models are models in which we "define the ranking function based on the probability that a given document d is relevant to a query q". Using language models for retrieval is one case of probabilistic retrieval models. The query likelihood retrieval model is a one language model approach.  Query likelihood is an approach wherein we assume that each query word is obtained from the document and each query word is generated independently. "The probability of relevance can be approximated by the probability of a query given a document and relevance, p(q | d , R = 1)".  I guess what you really want is p(R=1|q, d), but you don't have the "big table" of relevance judgements available to you.  You do have the documents available, so you can calculate p(q|d), and p(q,d) is approximately p(R=1|q,d).  Is it that you use a language model of the document to calculate the probability of the query? from my understanding:  a **language model** is really just a probability distribution over word sequences. this can also be called a *generative model* because it can be used as a probabilistic mechanism for generating text. however, language models are also useful for information retrieval.  the **query likelihood** is the probability that, given a certain relevant document that the user wants to view, how likely is it that the user would provide a certain query? we tend to make the assumption that each query word is generated independently, with each word picked from the user's ideal "imaginary document" (though this assumption can be revised to prohibit zero probabilities from occurring by saying the user is picking query terms from a *language model* instead -- one that doesn't have zero probabilities. in fact, even just using the "document" is a language model, it is just a "document" language model instead of something like a "collection" language model that is built off of the entire collection, so it is more restricted). this query likelihood can then be used to calculate rankings.   a **probabilistic retrieval model** is an information retrieval technique that then tries to use the statistical *language models* to generate *query likelihoods* in order to rank relevant documents and return them to the user  happy to clarify further if that didn't make sense

Submission History Hi, I was able to git add, push and commit my code to my private repo and see the change on github. But I don't see anything in the submission history. Wondering how long it took for you guys to show up. I followed all the 14 steps in the instructions pdf. Hoping that I didn't miss any stepIt took a couple of minutes.  The first time I forgot to push, though.  It's been 20 minutes and I still don't see it Oops I had the wrong link to the webhook, just changed it and redelivered and it went through fine. Thanks for you help :) is the webhook link: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger? Is it correct? I met the same issue.
Syllabus for Exam 1 Hi,  Will exam 1 cover Week 1 - Week 6 ? Or till Week 7?I think it covers week 1 - week 6. Based on lesson 6.10 "summary for exam 1", I believe that yes, the first exam should only cover weeks 1 - 6.  As well, it looks like weeks 13 - 16 are dedicated to our group project work with no introduction of new lecture material, so exam 2 should be focused on week 7 - 12 (splitting the material into 2 - 6 week segments). Exam 1 will cover topics from week 1 to 6. Please refer exam 1 summary video posted by professor -  'Lesson 6.10: Summary for Exam 1' on Campuswire.
library/package restriction? Hey,  I want to check in and see whether we have any restrictions in using python libraries or packages to complete MP3-PLSA implementation.

What I can think of is I used math.log2() here.   try use math.log(x,2) instead, I think livedatalab does not support log2() many thanks! this time,  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/1984322f-32ad-4628-ab9c-afd436011778/image.png) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4f1b44a0-f0df-4fe7-956b-cc657a4b10ed/image.png) I do not have the p-value txt. Does this mean that at least the code for the InL2  works that I can  proceed to the 2nd part? Thanks! it does not allow me to answer your last update so answering here. No, it looks like your equation is still not correct. You can create significance.txt and put your p-value number in it manually.
Question about practice quiz of week 9 The question is **Which of the following generative descriptions is not TRUE about PLSA?**  And the incorrect answer is: **To generate a topic assignment for a word,  a coin is tossed to decide if the topic is from the background topic or not, and the probability of the background is a constant specified by the user.**  The explanation is:  **The probability of background component weight is learned not fixed.**  I am confused by this explanation. Isn't the probability of the background component fixed?  Thank you.  The algorithm tries to learn the parameters that is best likely to generate the topic assignment for a word. One of the parameters is the probability of background model. This means, the algorithm 'predicts' the most likely probability for the background model. But, the option implies that the probability is fixed by the outcome of a random event. Therefore, that is not true.  The background language model is obtained using the whole collection. It is not specified by a user. That is what the explanation means.
Tech Review Page Count We are told that "It must be at least ~2 pages" long. Does this mean two pages double spaced, or two pages single spaced? Because we don't require a specific format, single or double spacing is fine. 
Additional office hours for projects Hi everyone,  As we are entering the "project" phase of the class, I will begin to hold office hours for answering questions about any aspect of the projects.  The office hours will be held [on Zoom](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/3277733087?pwd=VXZNMGJ4WENvS0Yrd1hlNTFWelRDQT09) during the following time:  Every Sunday (starting the 23rd) , from 8:00pm - 9:00pm CT.   If you cannot make office hours, feel free to post your question(s) on Campuswire, and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.   Best, Kevin 
OkapiBM25 parameters Hi Everyone, I am am using OkapiBM25 and have tried several times by tunning b,k1,k3, but was not able to beat the baseline. Can anyone provide any hint on which direction I should go with to tune these parameters? ThanksYou are already in the right direction. Hyperparameter tuning can be a bit tricky and manual at times. First, it's definitely helpful to understand the actual purpose of these parameters and range of values they can take. Then based on those you can mess around with some values just to gain a better intuition (which I'm sure you've already been doing).  From there, you can simply iterate through the different combinations of b, k1, and k3 and save the hyperparameter tuple that results in the best performance (but be careful about overfitting maybe?). The easiest way to do this is probably to modify your search_eval.py to have a triply nested loop. You could also write a shell script which calls search_eval.py with different params.  I hope this points you in a helpful direction without explicitly saying "Hey, use parameters like this..." part of this link helped me in understanding and tuning the parameters.  https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-3-considerations-for-picking-b-and-k1-in-elasticsearch
MP1 - Can't load config.toml correctly Hi, I'm following the guide and everything worked fine until this last step. Can anybody tell me what's wrong here?   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/bdab0d6e-ee8f-4e23-99be-ed643df28fab/image.png)  I've copied the config exactly as it is in the guide and saved it in my working dir. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/5b1563d4-cb0a-41fb-9eb5-e8b42c23e5af/image.png)   Thank you!Can you check if any special characters were added while copying the file or any character removed Maybe try to put it in your python script folder MP1_private?  Hi. Thank you for your answer, but that’s not my working directory…  Given the error message, your `config.toml` may have a syntax error. You can check [their docs](https://toml.io/en/) and examples to ensure all the values are set up correctly. Additionally, did you download the extra packages required to run the pipeline? These are: - https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/releases/download/v3.0.2/crf.tar.gz - https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/releases/download/v3.0.2/greedy-constituency-parser.tar.gz  As a side note, you can produce the output required by the **autograder** only modifying `example.py` to implement the token stream defined in the guide.
Proposal content The project overview says:  "Detailed instructions about the required content of the proposal will be provided by Week 4, including a short set of questions that need to be answered in the proposal. As long as those questions are addressed (wherever applicable), the proposal does not have to be very long. A couple of sentences for each question would be sufficient."  Where can we find the list of questions?List of questions are given after end of every topic in CS410 Project Topics.docx . Look for the below section in the document ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d891ef49-62dc-4354-a0f5-ca91e83c2bd5/image.png)
Unable to add Youtube and PDF to CS410 DL. The extension doesnt highlight the PDF Text and doesnt accept youtube URL. Any idea how to submit these ?Not sure about the PDF text as I haven't tried it yet, but I just submitted a youtube url and that worked for me. What is the format of your youtube url? I followed the instructions in the file CS410 Digital Library Instructions and was able to figure it out. As per the instructions you have to do this for the YouTube video:  **If you want to ask a question at a specific time, you can change the webpage URL to include the video time (right click video → copy URL at current time → paste into browser), and re-open the extension.** If it isn't highlighting for you, it can be copy pasted as per the instruction in the google doc: **For some pages, your highlighted text will not be captured by the extension. You can tell that this is the case when the “Highlighted text:” area doesn’t display any text. If you want to save the highlighted text in the context or ask a question about the highlighted text, then first copy-paste it into the field right below the highlighted text display.**  Adding one more point to the discussion: you should not copy-paste URLs into the extension itself (e.g., pasting URLs into the highlighted text field or into the explanation field). Moreover, you should not make any submissions from "chrome://*" page. If you try either of these, you'll receive an error.   And a general note: this change was relatively recent (noticed in the logs that this was happening), so no worries for those who have already submitted content this way (will not affect grades). But if you have time, you can visit Your Submissions on http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000 and delete + resubmit any malformed submissions. One easy way to check if a submission has the correct format is if you click the submission and the URL redirect works.  For YouTube videos, the highlighted textfield will be empty, right? The highlighted text field can be used if the highlighted text did not show up above the field. You should be able to highlight any text on the youtube page, but it may not always pop up so copying the text prior to opening the extension may be necessary! I am confused what can be the sources of text in case of YouTube videos.  As YouTube doesn't have video transcriptions like Coursera videos and usually the video descriptions are not informative, shall we copy texts from comments of YouTube videos?  I was able to highlight the text of the video title and see it when I open the extension. Please see screenshot below:  ![Screenshot%20from%202022-09-11%2015-47-26.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a753baf6-c170-4b4a-9ed2-50e2e0492f88/Screenshot%20from%202022-09-11%2015-47-26.png) Got it, thanks a lot! Sorry to say but the instructions on adding Youtube videos didnt made sense to me initially. After the fields didnt accept the URL , Based on the screenshot in on of the replies below , I highlight the title of the video which opens the Youtube link in the tinman link. I hope thats acceptable.  to be honest , this was an accidental discovery. It seems to be a good extension but it can be better by having a better user guide. Example with screenshots. Thats would have helped saved a lot of time . it was the URL from chrome https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAXpvHhQow  But based on the screenshot above , when i highlight the title of Video and submit to extension , seems like it recorded the video link. I wish this was more clearer in the user guide. I guess I got confused thinking videos would be recorded in a different way then regular websites.
setting up MP1 I'm using Mac M1, and previously I have the same issue as #19, then I tried to create a conda virtual environment with python 3.5, as suggested in #39 student answer. Now my terminal looks like this, does it mean the package is installed successfully and I could start working on the MP? ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-23%20at%2022.14.38.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/cb986024-9947-46e5-bce9-4ef18ff71ab7/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-23%20at%2022.14.38.png)  Thanks in advance.Hello there, as I just posted in the answer to #28, for me I got things figured out following this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70205633/cannot-install-python-3-7-on-osx-arm64  Hope you find it helpful.  Thank you! I also have an M1 machine. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy doesn't work on M1. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153
from collections import Counter Are we allowed to import Counter from collections?No, the provided import should be enough. The autograder may not support other packages.  I did and the autograder worked fine. If it's not allowed, then it's not being enforced, and given the low engagement of the staff, it's unlikely to be.
Cannot Get the MP3 Resource PDFs Hi,   I'm getting "This site can’t be reached" error when downloading those 3 provided resource PDFs (at the bottom of the `readme.md` ). I have tried to use the UIUC VPN but still getting the same error. I was wondering if anyone else sees the same issue?  Thanks I have the same issue. Confirming I also see the same issue, seems like this will require guidance from one of the TA's or professor.   It looks like the material for the course hasn't been updated in about 5 years, because all the links are at least that old. Therefore, the hosting procedure for a lot of these resources (e.g.: faculty homepages, course websites) has changed in that time, sometimes more than once.  That being said, it was straightforward to find [Prof. Zhai's new homepage](https://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) by googling him (just like we learned in class!), and then applying the same relative path to resolve the first link successfully: * [Cheng's note](https://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/pub/em-note.pdf) on EM algorithm  I'm thinking the other two are lost to history as, unlike faculty homepages, they don't bother to migrate course pages across servers / services / hosting platforms, as far as I can tell. In fact, the link to the course ([CS 598 CXZ - Advanced Topic in Information Retrieval (Fall 2016)](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs598cxz)) from Prof.'s homepage is likewise dead. If you answer the question with a statement, it marks it as resolved, and then the TA's can't see it. As above, if you answer the question with a statement, it marks it as resolved, and then the TA's can't see it. I noticed that and promptly changed it back to unresolved. If it showed as resolved, that was the result of the other response. 
M-step Normalization Hi,   I feel a little confused. So for the content in the video, the normalizations for pi and p are different. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f823916a-26f9-4e8b-a571-16284447769c/image.png)  Do we need to implement different normalizations for them in MP3? Thanks!$$\pi$$ and $$p$$ are different values: the first is the document topic probabilities $$p(z | d)$$, the second is the topic word probabilities $$p(w|z)$$  generally, without a background model, PLSA EM has two steps: 1. E-step: calculate $$p(z_{dw} = j)$$ 2. M-step: calculate updated values for both $$\pi_{dj}^{(n+1)}$$ and $$p^{(n + 1)}(w | \theta_j)$$  so if i understood your question correctly, the answer is yes. the M-step calculates two quantities (or two matrices), each with a different denominator for normalization. please let me know if i misunderstood, im happy to try to clarify further The normalizations are basically identical to the formula in the slides, except that you do not need to consider the background model. 
Quiz 1 Review Hi I'm reviewing quiz 1 for the exam and was confused on a couple of the questions.   Question 5 In the "simplest" VSM instantiation, however, using word count instead of 0-1 bit vectors, if we concatenate each document by itself, will the ranking list still remain the same?  Ans) Yes, it will remain the same  Question 6 In Text Retrieval problem for N distinct documents, select statements below that are correct?  Ans) Doc selection is 2^N and Doc ranking is N!  For question 5 I'm confused on what it means by "concatenate each document by itself" and also what exactly it means to use word count instead of 0-1 bit vectors. Does this mean just a singular number representing the total number of words in the document?   For question 6 I understand how doc ranking is N! because you have to compare a document to every other document, but I can't comprehend why doc selection is 2^N. I thought doc selection would be 2 * N since you have to use absolute relevance, so there can only be 2 outcomes per document, whether it is relevant (value of 1) or not (value of 0). For question 6: Since there can be 2 outcomes per document, the selections would be: 2x2x2.... (n times) = 2^N For Question 5: Let's consider a simple document, d1: "this is a text mining document about text"  Word Count will just count up the number of words in the document (ie count of word "text" in d1 is 2, instead of 0-1 bit vector which would just put 1 for presence of the term or 0 for absence of term) Now, if we concatenate the document by itself, d1 becomes: "this is a text mining document about text this is a text mining document about text". Well, this changed the count of the word text in d1, as it is now 4. However, we've concatenated *every* document by itself, so the relative ranking will remain the same.   please let me know if that made sense, i can clarify further  Oh i see I was thinking about it in the wrong manner then. Thanks! Ahhhhhh I see that makes much more sense. I now see what the word count is and understand it's concatenation every document with itself. Thank you for the example and explanation Ryan!
DL Search Engine Website Down? Can't seem to access the website and the extension isn't responding either. Can an instructor look into this? Trying to get the MP done on time.

MP 2.2 Not seeing submissions Hello,  I would like to view my queries but the "My submissions" page is showing me this. Is this an issue on my end?

Seems like this is a problem with people who needed to make new accounts for the webpage. There is a bug in the code which does not render the number of submitted judgments when the submissions are empty.   There are three options:  1. Make a submission using the Chrome extension with the account currently logged into the webpage. 2. Right-click, inspect element, check the response from the server for the key "num_judgments". If this number is >=5, then you will get full credit. 3. Tell me your email that you used to sign up, and I can quickly check the backend for you.

EM Algorithm   What is the w' prime in the M-step?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/494032e2-e4a0-41ac-af10-447d2f3138af/image.png)The denominator of that equation is a normalizer. Whereas the numerator operates on a given word, $$w$$, whatever that may be, the denominator divides the result of that expression by the same expression summed across *all* of the words in the vocabulary $$V$$; $$w'$$ simply represents the current word in that sum of all words in $$V$$. That helps, thanks.

MP2.3 Still Says Overdue in Coursera Hello, who can I contact about my grade for MP 2.3. I submitted it on time and live data lab says that I have passed, but Coursera still says that the assignment is overdue.May be you can drop mail to TAs. They are usually very prompt and helpful in such cases.  Thanks - where are their emails listed?  Have not been able to find anywhere in Coursera. Hello Steve, I will take a look at this and get back to you. Does Coursera not show any grade? Correct. Coursera shows no grade and Overdue. I have informed the TA who will take a look at this issue. Updated Thanks, I have received a grade now.
Zipf's law 10. Question 10 What does Zipf's law tell you?  There are only a few words that have a small probability.   There are many words that have a small probability.   Words are evenly distributed.  The answer is - There are many words that have a small probability.  Could someone please explain why is that the case ? Basically it is referring to the fact that there are in general many words from the vocabulary that are less frequent in a document. If you pick a large sample of the documents you will find many words that are less frequently used in the document related to the other words. If you think about the set of stop words - like "a", "the" "is" etc . but the list of such word is still limited. Hence it is mentioned , there are few words(like above) that have high probability occurring in any document. But there are many many other words that have smaller probability and are rare. Hope this helps ! If it helps, can refer to the video explaining this law in detail  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVmf8MKev5M You can refer to the video and slide. But briefly, many words are seldom to use.

Quiz 4 Problem From my perspective, if we double terms in one document, C(w,d) should double, but |d| remains same, then probability should change, why this choice is correct?  ![%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2022-10-15%20%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%881.36.52.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/df2ecda8-5be5-45ec-8488-8300bc06ca0f/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2022-10-15%20%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%881.36.52.png)The question says "If word count **for every term doubles**...". So from my understanding, the count every individual term would double but so would the document length, therefore the term remains the same value. When word count doubles for each term then the document length |d| is also gonna double.  Thanks bro, quite confusing. JM Smoothing interpolates between the ML Estimate and the Collection model. Doubling term count will not impact the collection model. Will it impact the Maximum Likelihood estimate? Consider a simple document "the text" the ML estimate for `the` is $$\frac{1}{2}$$ and for `text` $$\frac{1}{2}$$; what happens if we double the terms? "the text the text" well now, not only does the numerator for the ML estimate change, but so does the denominator: $$p("the"|d) = p("text"|d) =\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$$  While Dirichlet-prior also interpolates between ML estimate and collection model, the smoothing coefficients are based on document length and thus will be impacted by changes like this. however in JM smoothing the ML estimate is just multiplied by a constant coefficient, so it will not be impacted
MP2.3 Question Do I have to change the return of load_ranker? I have been a bit lost as to what I should do after implementing the score for a single term in single_score.That's correct.   This is from https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.3:  "Do not forget to call the InL2 ranker by editing the return statement of load_ranker function inside search_eval.py." Do we have to invoke the score_one function after creating an instance of the InL2Ranker class? If we have to call the score_one function, what would the input parameter of the score_one function be? How do we get access to the score_data file to pass it in as input into this score_one function? You don't need to invoke the score_one function, just return an instance from load_ranker. So we simply return InL2Ranker() in the load_ranker function? correct
LiveDataLab hanging when I try to see submission logs Has anyone seen this problem? The grader seems to be working at least partially because I am getting a partial score.Make sure you have done the two tasks. I have both modified the search_eval.py and included the significance.txt. The grader gave me full score.  Thanks. I figured out that a print statement that I had in score_one was generating so much output is was causing the logs screen to hang Nice!
MP1 Overdue in Coursera Hello, I noticed that I saw my MP1 was considered overdue in coursera's Grade tab, but I have turned it in on time and fully functional. I followed the instructions in setting up and my livedatalab is linked to gitlab.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a9932231-70f2-49d2-b3eb-d1f382dcb33c/image.png)  From opentool(coursera) are you able to point to livedatalab. If that works, it should immediately update the results. It always takes me to a webpage saying it is not secure, I have to click the link to manually redirect to livedatalab and login in each time.  Are you still seeing this error? Looks like coursera is updated. If Datalab works, then it's ok
Generative Mixture Model I have a question regarding week 5 contents. In Generative Mixture Model, lambda is referred to as noise in feedback documents. I understood that if the lambda value goes up, a larger portion of the collection/background model is used as part of the feedback language model. However, on the next slide which gives an example, if the lambda value is larger, it more uses the topic model. I think these two slides are contradictory. Which point did I misunderstand? ![%E1%84%89%E1%85%B3%E1%84%8F%E1%85%B3%E1%84%85%E1%85%B5%E1%86%AB%E1%84%89%E1%85%A3%E1%86%BA%202022-10-10%20%E1%84%8B%E1%85%A9%E1%84%92%E1%85%AE%208.56.46.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a5b5f9b8-e5ea-4fdc-9c05-b9b66de8c95a/%E1%84%89%E1%85%B3%E1%84%8F%E1%85%B3%E1%84%85%E1%85%B5%E1%86%AB%E1%84%89%E1%85%A3%E1%86%BA%202022-10-10%20%E1%84%8B%E1%85%A9%E1%84%92%E1%85%AE%208.56.46.png) ![%E1%84%89%E1%85%B3%E1%84%8F%E1%85%B3%E1%84%85%E1%85%B5%E1%86%AB%E1%84%89%E1%85%A3%E1%86%BA%202022-10-10%20%E1%84%8B%E1%85%A9%E1%84%92%E1%85%AE%208.56.53.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/2d80c441-9ce9-449b-9ef2-1aab3d571d30/%E1%84%89%E1%85%B3%E1%84%8F%E1%85%B3%E1%84%85%E1%85%B5%E1%86%AB%E1%84%89%E1%85%A3%E1%86%BA%202022-10-10%20%E1%84%8B%E1%85%A9%E1%84%92%E1%85%AE%208.56.53.png) From my understanding, the explanation of this lecture sounds reasonable.  Here we have two language models $$\theta$$ for topic words and $$C$$ for background words. As you understand, $$\lambda$$ denotes the noise amount in the feedback document.  Then, if we set $$\lambda$$ to be small, $$\theta$$ has the responsibility to allocate more probabilities to common words instead of $$C$$ in order to achieve $$\arg \max_{\theta} \log p(F|\theta)$$.  I hope this helps and would appreciate any feedback on my understanding! Thanks a lot! Your explanation was helpful. My question has been resolved.
Lecture 9.2 x=y calculation Hi, I am confused about the calculation of p("text"|$$\theta_d$$) and p("the"|$$\theta_d$$). Ho do we come to the equation p("text"|$$\Lambda$$) = p("the"|$$\Lambda$$)?  We know that p("text"|$$\theta_d$$) + p("the"|$$\theta_d$$) = 1. Do we assume that p("text"|$$\Lambda$$) + p("the"|$$\Lambda$$) = constant, so that we can use the above equation? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/845cecfa-1605-4bd5-87d2-a391a79daaaa/image.png) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f3d6ee8c-0fe2-429c-b9b9-30f4787d46ed/image.png)  You can prove it by calculating derivative.  x = p("text"| Λ ) y = p ("the" | Λ )  We want p(d | Λ) to be the maximum, this is when x = y. We know that $$p("text"|\theta_{d}) + p("the"|\theta_{d}) $$ is a constant. This would mean that the sum of  $$[0.5*p("text"|\theta_{d}) + 0.5*0.1]$$ and $$[0.5*p("the"|\theta_{d}) + 0.5*0.9]$$ is a constant. Which implies that $$p("text"|\Lambda) + p("the"|\Lambda)$$ is a constant. Three points: 1. We are doing an estimation among the two to maximize their product.  2. Since we know their sum is always equal to 1, we exploit the general mathematical rule that, when two variables sum to a constant, their product is maximum when they are equal. 3. Thus, to maximize product using the 2nd rule, we assume that they should be equal to each other (which has to be 0.5 in this case).
MP2.3 Valid P-Value So I submitted the MP and I noticed that I get the following error in my output in LiveDataLab:   ``` Requirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: scandir; python_version < "3.5" in /home/livelab_jenkins_user/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from pathlib2; python_version < "3"->importlib-resources; python_version < "3.7"->tqdm) (1.10.0)  FEEDBACK: significance.txt not found or does not contain a valid float value!!!  Finished: SUCCESS ```  I noticed taht the file is included in the github, but I want to check to see if the following value in the file is valid for the test cases: ``` Ttest_relResult(statistic=3.6197939408479907, pvalue=0.00036453477845628475) ``` Is this a correct value/form of output? the `Ttest_relResult` is an object that represents two values: a `test statistic` and `p-value`. MP2.3 asks to extract just the `p-value` from this result. From the MP2.3 `README`:  > Write the p-value in a file called significance.txt. Do not include anything else in the file, just this number!   Oh okay! Thank you!

Submission Failing without any Logs Just in case you run into a similar issue, I had an error where when I submitted MP 2.4, the submission would immediatly fail in live data lab and no logs were displayed. I realized that the personal access token I used to link live data lab with my github account had expired. To fix it, just delete your linked account on live data lab and redo the [steps](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/56yaHRT_TDSsmh0U_zw0pg_0a5a1bc92b31433ca575124f8b5cfbe4_LiveDataLab-setup.pdf?Expires=1664323200&Signature=AQux~EYBec9st2X6d~SRj816Fq99vNcdnEItobI3m7-IuMrnrMeg0o3K7ChI1Y4gIV6mcIP~4xpwAXay-dtAExxMCiCuPgFsepf12INVmMynMW2-bNnMfoJB9m3nQkr7vqaumGBSmYr4qozMEiqoVcsjzSJNwgNWCgulNjMJWHc_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) to link your github account to live data lab. 
Doubt about Scoring Question in Practice Quiz 4  If a document does not contain all of the words in the query, then based on the formula in the lecture, S1 would be 0 but there is a chance that S2 would not be 0 hence I am confused about how this won't change the ranking of the documents. (I understand how the ranking would not change if S1 and S2 are nonzero but confused about the case when S1 could be 0)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/47f16524-e209-408a-af28-22d29c9cd885/image.png)So based on the assumption if the term is not in the document we will have the probability replaced by probability for the term in the Collection multiplied by alpha d.  I think S1 will never be 0. Thank you, that makes sense! But I guess then are we just supposed to assume that in this question, the scoring function includes smoothening? My understanding is yes, reason being, if not then the probability will become 0 because of  unseen words. Oh okay, thank you! The professor’s presentation style being both iterative and expository may be causing some confusion; specifically, building up ranking algorithms from scratch, asking students to think about failure modes, and then extending based on guided intuition. In practice, though, my guess is that nothing in history was called a “scoring function” unless it included smoothing, because that failure mode is so glaring and catastrophic as to make any system not based on that assumption unusable.  Here’s a really trivial example based on a navigational query for “the Facebook”. If there’s no “the” on the home page, it fails completely to deliver the only page the user cares about. That makes sense, thank you for the example

Problems with installing python 3.5 and metapy on M1 MacBook Hey there,  I am having problems installing python 3.5 (with Pyenv or anaconda) and metapy on a clean M1 MacBook Pro (despite installing cmake as suggested here https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/19).   After quite some research, it appears numerous postings have described similar issues with installing python 3.5 on M1 Mac. Please see [here,](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70472350/issue-in-installing-python-3-5-10-using-pyenv-in-macos-12-0-m1-arm64) [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1643) and [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65653464/installation-of-earlier-versions-of-python-prior-to-3-8-fails-on-mac-with-m1-c)   Any help would be appreciated.   And to our TA, I am curious what did people with M1 Mac do in previous years?  Thanks.Rather than try to get the older version of python running on my M1, I set up a free-tier Amazon EC2 instance, and am using the Remote SSH VSCode plugin to connect to it. Heres a summary of the process https://medium.com/mpercept-academy/connecting-aws-ec-instance-with-visual-studio-code-f7bbf388e9df   Hello ,   I have Python installed on my MacBook Pro. The best way to do it is via Anaconda. Install anaconda and use Python in VSCode with Conda installation. https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/  https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/python-vsc/ Thanks Prateek! Do you mind I ask if you installed python 3.5? I did try Anaconda however could not get Python below 3.7 installed this way. Thanks! That’s a great idea Nate and I may take this route! I assume you had Metapy installed this way without problem as well? Yep! There's just a bit more setup overall with installing Git/pip/etc. Also need to be careful to commit your changes.. since they won't be saved locally I got metapy to work by installing Python 3.7 and then using the appropriate `cp37` built distribution from here:  https://pypi.org/project/metapy/#files  You can install a built distribution using `pip install <whl_url>` where `<whl_url>` is the appropriate link for your environment from the PyPI metapy link above. I have Python 3.9 installed. Just noticed that the default MacBook came with 3.8 pre installed. My apologies , as I didn't notice you were trying to get 3.5 installed. May I know why? In past example while doing AML Labs , latest version of python worked fine for me.  The MP1 setup instructions mention to use 2.7 or 3.5. Not sure what effects other versions may have. oh ok... have'nt started MP1 yet. I would ask TA if we can use higher versions. Yes as Gautam mentioned python 3.5 is recommended for MP1. Plus metapy could not be installed with the python 3.10 I currently have. Thank you there! Wondering how did you get python 3.7 installed? Seems the earliest version anaconda offers is v3.8.11. Thanks!  Hello all,  Just wish to let you know thanks to all replies and after quite some struggling, I was able to install python 3.7 and Metapy with conda following method in think link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70205633/cannot-install-python-3-7-on-osx-arm64  5 hours of life that will never come back...:) Which command did you use to install metapy at the end after setting up the conda environment py37? . For anyone facing the issue of installing metapy on their Mac M1/M1 Pro machines, I believe there are a couple of reasons: - Metapy does not work after python 3.7 and most of the Mac machines come with python 3.8+ installed.  - The metapy package requires "cmake" to be installed and it is not found.  The easiest way to resolve both of these issues is to install Anaconda and use it to both install cmake as well as get the right python version. Here are the steps that worked for me:  1. Download the Anaconda from their website. 2. In your terminal, enter (this will download cmake for you) ``` conda install cmake ``` 3. Next, enter the following to create an environment to use python 3.7. ``` conda create -n $PYTHON37_ENV_NAME python=3.7 anaconda conda activate python=3.7 ``` 4. Next, in your terminal, type in  ``` conda install python=3.7 ``` 5. Next activate your environment ``` conda activate python=3.7 ``` 6. You can check your python version is 3.7 here by typing "python --version" 7. Now try installing metapy again in your python 3.7 environment: ``` pip install metapy pytoml ``` metapy should successfully install now. Hope this helped!  Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43630002/conda-install-downgrade-python-version  I believe I first activated the new condo environment and then used pip to install. Hope this helps.  Thanks for this great summary Gautam and well stated!  One caveat I would mention is that you downloaded the Anaconda or Minoconda version for M1 Mac, you would not be able to find python 3.7 in their repository. In this case I used the method mentioned here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70205633/cannot-install-python-3-7-on-osx-arm64) to first create an environment with x86_64 architecture, after which python 3.7 can be found. Just to add you could find you condo build use "condo info" and look for platform. For me it says osx-arm64. I suppose if you installed condo for Mac intel and Rosetta you may find python 3.7 in the repository right away. I believe I did see a message about Rosetta when I got Anaconda. This is is the link I used for the download: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg I believe this was the one for x86 anyways. Here you go and I think you are totally right! Boy I wish I had just downloaded the x86 version of anaconda instead of M1 version, that would have saved a ton of trouble!!! I have a MacBook Air M2. This works for me.![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-29%20at%2016.37.57.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b06da986-ca96-4c2c-a825-18b74a1b2cb2/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-29%20at%2016.37.57.png) I think as long as you have rosetta installed, either docker or anaconda will work. Personally I like docker better. Too much dark magic in conda for me. I also have an M1 machine. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy doesn't work on M1. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153 Even I was unable to get metapy to install correctly on my computer. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy works natively there. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153   The older version of python works fine on the M1.   I have an M1 machine and was able to get it to run fine using the anaconda distribution and creating a python 3.5 project ``` conda create -n cs410project1 python=3.5 conda activate cs410project1  pip install metapy pytoml   Python 3.5.6 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Aug 26 2018, 16:30:03)  [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import metapy ``` I'm stuck on the `conda activate python=3.7` step. Trying to run this after step three, or skipping it and then trying to run step 5 both cause this error: ``` Could not find conda environment: python=3.7 You can list all discoverable environments with `conda info --envs` ``` Running that list command shows this: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/30ac4407-dfa6-4740-a0b6-bcf032f25753/image.png) I'm on windows, but facing the same problem so I'm not sure how to continue. I know that it's possible to just use google colab, but I want to get it working on my computer :( I will try to answer here. I think what Gautam meant in step 3 is:  ``` conda create -n $PYTHON37_ENV_NAME (this should be the environment name you create; say cs410) python=3.7 anaconda conda activate python=3.7 (this could be a typo; I think the right command should be condo activate $ENV_NAME; say condo activate cs410)  ```  In your case, you can try condo activate $PYTHON37_ENV_NAME (though I would try an easier env name)  Hope this help This may be an issue on Windows- on a Mac machine the conda activate command I stated above works as expected. It is possible that the solution that Hanyin proposed works on Windows machines.

MP1 project Account is linked to github project for MP1, but i dont see how to submit the code and run the test on it?  Thanks. You commit your code to your github project, then the webhook will submit it to LiveDataLab automatically. 
change topic after proposal Hi TA/Instructor,  Are we allowed to change the topic after 10/23, for example,  if we find the topic we choose is not manageable or achievable at a later stage?   Or for the same topic, we changed some implementation details such the "expected outcome" mentioned in the proposal.  ThanksI guess we are free to change the topic after the review process as writen in the project ideas. Yes, you are allowed to change the topic + implementation details after the deadline. 
Cannot create a private room for the project Hello, does anyone know how to create a private chatroom in Campuswire?  The button is disabled for us for some reason. ![chatroom.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/518e0097-e675-45e2-9495-923659229905/chatroom.png)   I've always just done Slack for group project chats True, Slack works as well. But it would be better if we could consolidate everything into one place instead of having to switch between the two platforms.  I think I just gave permission for students to make private chat rooms - please let me know if you can do it now! Hi Kevin, yep just created a private chat room for my group. Thanks!! Great, no problem!
MP3 Shows as Green in Datalab but no score is shown 0 in leaderboard I am facing an issue similar to #941, where the submission is showing as SUCCESS and green in livedatalab but my score on leaderboard is showing 0. My netid is ojasvia2. Can i get some guidance on this ? I was in the same situation and found that the SUCCESS label on the submission log does not mean the correct implementation. So you should probably find any mistakes in your codes. Were you able to get the right score after correcting the mistakes ?  Yep. I can see the log likelihood values converging, still i am seeing a score of 0. It took 9 iterations on the autograder for me.  I see. As for your codes, it might be better to ask TAs! Yep, I had the same situation where my log likelihood was increasing but I was still getting '0'. Turns out I did have calculation errors - it's quite hard to debug unfortunately.  I had the similar issues in the beginning. For my case, I didn’t update the numbers in my EM steps correctly while all other operations were correct (for example the shapes of all the matrixes and calculating the likelihood). This caused I passed but scored a zero. The auto grader not only checks if you converged or not, but also checks if your final EM matrixes are correct. Sometimes incorrect matrixes can lead to convergence of likelihood. After I fixed my EM steps, the score became “1”.  Also try to open the tool via Coursera first
Proposal reviews on CMT For the proposal peer-reviews on CMT, is it adequate to answer the questions prefixed by [PROPOSAL] and then "Save Draft", rather than "Submit"?  Or is there some other way to submit our review and comments.Sam, I believe the directions say to answer non-proposal questions by typing "N/A" or clicking the "Not due yet" radio button. The other answer is correct - please put whatever for the non-proposal questions and click "Submit" Thanks! Do you happen to know where these instructions are defined? Hi Joel - these instructions are embedded within the CMT review page itself.  I missed them when I first looked at the site.
Will we have an MP4 ?  Hi Ta’s and Professor,   Will we have an MP4, and if so when will it be due? What will be the percentage that this MP will be worth if we have it?   Thank you,  Sruthi In an earlier post, one of the TAs said there will an MP4 but no other details were given. This post mentions that there will be a MP4 in the responses: https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/795 Aren't the project and tech review not enough? Changing the course schedule like that with 1 month remaining in the semester is pretty annoying since some of us already planned everything according to the deadlines given in the beginning.   Please, instructors and TAs, no MP4 The semester is coming to an end. Soon, we are going to have our Winter break, which just left us with around 3 weeks till the exam to do the MP. As of today, it is not released yet, which is weird. Usually, the rest of the MPs were released very quickly. And on top of all this, we also have our tech reviews + project. Please, NO MP4.
The dates on the page are outdated ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/127ab6b5-899b-4adc-aa23-3c73e77f8a95/image.png)  On week 1, technology-review-information section has deadlines and  they are outdated.  Probably not an important issue because I expect that there will be another actual guideline for 2022 and regard this page just as an overview of what we will be doing in this course.  Thank you.Thanks for catching the problem, Danwoo! We'll correct them.  We are in the process of systematically reviewing all the content, which, as you noticed, was copied from last year, and will make sure to correct all such problems.  
MP2.3 - ranker.score(...) taking too long  I am going through MP2.3 tutorial, and got to the, "Varying a parameter" section. I am trying to run the loop where we test our scoring function on our queries and docs, but the ranker.score function is taking too long... I am stuck on [*] on jupyter and am not sure what the issue is. I simply copy and pasted the code from the MP2.3 github. All of the code above this section ran as expected.   I am using Python 3.7.13   ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-24%20at%2012.00.00%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9b60e603-6ea0-44f4-ac7d-05e7589c1e0f/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-24%20at%2012.00.00%20AM.png)  there are some past posts maybe discussing similar issue #478 , maybe try version 3.5? I did not Jupyter, but I use python 3.5 which seems working Thank you, I switched to version 3.6 and it ended up working!
LiveDataLab don't sync github submission Background: I used to successfully link my github and livedatalab and had seen grade on livedata. But the ta told me since I old livedata account email address is not school email, I can't sync it to Coursera. So I created a new account and set a new link. Howerver, on github it shows ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/689300b0-b5eb-472e-a7b3-0edbdd0f9afc/image.png) But on livedata it can't recieve any submission. I already have the mp1 pushed to my github( repushing didn't help).Hello, this is because our backend does not allow two livedatalab accounts to be linked to the same Github account. I've deleted both of your accounts, can you recreate your livedatalab account with the illinois email and then resubmit?  Got it fixed, thx! Hm. Yes, that is the right link, can you try reloading?
Pre-Quiz 7 Cross Product of Matrix ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/713d250e-1c62-4baa-b949-24b63c4ba8b8/image.png)  Hi there, in this question, $$x^T$$ is just an easy form to display the matrix? So the actual expression is still $$M \times x  $$, and also the result is transposed?  I am confused about this question.That's what I assumed as well. Or you could do $$ x^T \times  M$$ and end up with a 1x2 vector. Unclear. This was unclear to me as well, it should have been written:  What is the result of multiplying matrix M = $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\2 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$ by a vector **$$\vec{x}$$ where** $$x^T = [1,1]$$?  Then the problem becomes $$y = M \cdot \vec{x}$$ $$x^T$$ is the notation for the transpose of $$\vec{x}$$.  Since $$M$$ is $$2 \times 2$$ and $$\vec{x}$$ is $$1 \times 2$$, the transpose allows us to have proper dimensions for matrix multiplication. I agree. Looks like there is a mistake in the way the question is written. You can interpret it in the way Rick has suggested. I agree. It's the only way we can get answers. I agree
How are Feedback methods used? I am having some difficulties understanding how the feedback method we discussed are used. From the user's query, you can generate a new query (in the Rocchio Method) or a list of words (for Language Models).   What is then done with this new query or words? The user has already done their search, so it is not immediately usable. How is it used to improve future searches?  Can the new query be used to modify queries seen in the future, somehow? How do you know when it should be applied? Good question! There are multiple ways of using the new query.  First, in case of pseudo feedback, the new query can be executed immediately to provide the user with potentially better results. (In such a case, we just assume the top-k results from the initial query are relevant.) Second, if it's relevance feedback where the examples are explicitly labeled by the user as relevant or non-relevant, the expanded query can still be used to re-rank the unseen documents for this user. E.g., if the user interacted with the first page of results (e.g., 10 docs), the expanded query can be used to re-rank the results on the remaining pages that the user hasn't seen yet. Third, the expanded query can be useful for future users who might type in the same query or a similar query. 
what does score 0 mean for tech review report submission? I submit my tech review in pdf file. It score 0 in livedatalab. What does that mean for a score 0?? confused!It usually means that the pdf file is named incorrectly or not in the correct directory level in the repo. 
Why is PLSA "latent"? Hello,  As far as I understand, PLSA seems like EM algorithm with multiple topics.  Why would the name of PLSA have 'latent' in it?From my understanding, PLSA aims to clarify latent topics in documents.  The hidden variable $$z_{d,w} \in \{B,1,2,...,k\}$$ is also called a  latent class.  https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/courses/cs3750-Fall2007/lectures/plsa.pdf ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/edc6f83a-b64d-4cda-9f93-255b105ca053/image.png) Thanks :) just to add a little additional intuition/understanding of "latent" on top of Yutaro's answer  we consider these "latent" or "hidden" variables simply because they are not observed. we assume that there is some variable or some state there, that results in the observation we see. for example, let's see we have values that are drawn from 1 of 2 normal distributions. a value can be drawn from either: $$N(0, 5) \\ N(2, 7)$$ (so the means $$\mu_1 = 0, \mu_2  = 2$$, variances $$\sigma^2_1 = 5, \sigma^2_2 =  7$$)  If we draw a value and get "16", it is much more likely that the value came from the second distribution than the first; meanwhile a value of "1" could have easily come from either distribution. all that we observe here is the outputted value. However, there is a "hidden" variable for whether it was generated from the first distribution (we'll say `z = 0` for this case) or from the second distribution (`z = 1`). while we don't observe this, it is a part of the process and can be very helpful to model.  Because these underlying values are "hidden" we also refer to them as "latent" which has a similar meaning to "hidden" Thank you!
confused about the score_data I am lost in the file "score_data.h" which describes the fields of the sd object.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f4bc72a3-d5da-47cb-a740-1172d554418a/image.png) What is "struct score_data"? is the "inverted_index& idx" two fields or one field? could I  call the field just like the class?  the lines below the big chunk of comments are also confusing.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/51a5c407-85d6-4363-882d-f5313119047e/image.png) the arguments in the score_data() don't appear below the separating comment chunk.   Many thanks if anyone can help clarifying it.    You can treat score_data like an object that has all the needed attributes for your calculation. The score_data attributes are supposed to be used inside the score_one(self, sd) function. An example is below. Hope it helps. ```python  def score_one(self, sd):         """         You need to override this function to return a score for a single term.         For fields available in the score_data sd object,         @see https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html         """         example_calculation= sd.doc_term_count + sd.avg_dl +  sd.num_docs + sd.query_length ``` I find this link is much easier to understand https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html
Cannot access LiveDataLab I cannot access the LiveDataLab page via the link posted on [the Coursera orientation page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/irzBO/programming-assignments-overview).  http://livelab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/We are still working on it. It should be up in the coming week.  Hi there, please try the following link: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/course/join/WZS77P00E570J74   You should also see MP1 available now.    Thank you for your confirmation. It works for me, thanks! I am getting an internal server error when I try to access this livedatalab link. Is anyone else facing this? What is the correct link to access live data lab?
I can not see the submission history in LiveDataLab I pushed my code yesterday, but when I loged in my account on LiveDataLab, I only see "Loading submission history...".  How to solve this problem?Have you linked your github account on livedatalab and is your webhook working? Yes, I think the webhook is working. I now can see the score in Leaderboard is updated, but there is still no submission history, but now it is showing "No submissions are available or match the filter." on the page, does it matter? Are you seeing your grade on coursera? Yes, MP1 is shown as "Submitted"

NDCG@10 and overall score  sometimes i have a lower ndcg@10 score locally but my overall score on livedata is higher. Why? I thought the overall score should go up when ndcg@10 score go up.I believe it has something to do with overfitting. I have the similar experience where my local ndcg score is high, but livedatalab overall score is low. It is not always true that higher ndcg score equals to high livedatalab score. Locally we are able to test only on Cranfield data and therefore the local score is a reflection of how well the algorithm & parameter selection works on Cranfield dataset.   However, the overall score is calculated on 3 different datasets with varying weightage.  As per the MP2.4 READme  OverallScore  = 0.1* NDCG@10 on APNews + 0.3* NDCG@10 on Cranfield + 0.6* NDCG@10 on Faculty dataset.  Zhouya, The Cranfield, AP, and Faculty data sets are very different. As a result, there is no correlation between Cranfield NDCG and Faculty or AP NDCG, as can be seen in these scatter plots: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/737469f1-18be-4029-ad1e-27eab48e0076/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4359af55-8f43-43c6-8eae-59a58bdfadd9/image.png) These charts were made with Leaderboard data. The red one is Cranfield vs Faculty NDCG. The blue one is Cranfield vs. AP NDCG. I made these charts to see if any maximization strategy was possible. Unfortunately, it seems that the only strategy is guessing many times (or being very lucky). Nice! Thanks for looking into this.  I’m wondering what insights others have on this.
build_corpus When I print out the number of documents, it is 10. But it is supposed to be 1000. This might be a dumb question, but what is the correct way to read the document?Are you are referring to 'data/test.txt'? That file contains 1000 lines, where each line represents a single document. io Standard file open() should be fine. Just append the doc to the document list. you can read the document using standard python i/o functions such as `f = open(filename, 'r')` as others have described. then you can either iterate through the document and increment the counter every line for number of documents, or if you follow Anonymous' answer: > Standard file open() should be fine. Just append the doc to the document list.  then you should be able to get the number of documents from the length of the document list Open the file using any standard library and read each line using the respective readline function in the library u r using. Consider each line a document.
Reminder: CS410 MP2.1 released, due Sept 11th Hi everyone,  This is just a reminder that MP2.1 is due September 11th, 11:59pm CDT.   The description can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/FO1Ol/mp2-1).  Please take the time to read through the linked description and general overview documents. Also, note that MP2.1 (and eventually, MP2.2) are different than the old versions on LiveDataLab/Github, so please take a look at and follow the directions in the above link.  Thanks! -Kevin
MP3 Document Term Frequency Matrix I have been stuck on the Document Term Frequency for quite some time. If anyone could point me in the right direction as to if there are simple numpy functions that would allow this to happen or if this is truly meant to be done with for loops. I would assume the former to be true.   Thank youDillon, Please be more specific about where you are stuck. Are you referring to writing the build_doc_term_matrix function? In theory, you should be able to complete MP3 with numpy matrix operations in place of nested loops, and I'm sure it would be more efficient. I found it easiest to use nested loops, though, because I had to think very carefully about which iterables I was looping over (words in vocab, docs in the collection, or topics in the topic set).  In a couple of cases, though, I did use matrix operations and it seemed more logical. For example, you might want to divide one dimension of a 3D matrix by a certain value for normalization purposes...in several different spots. In that case, you might do something like...   `your_matrix[i, j, :] = your_matrix[i, j, :] / norm_value`  You could certainly re-write that with a triple-nested 'for' loop, but since you're doing the same operation (scalar division) on each iteration, the matrix operation made the most sense to me.  Hope this helps! Seth, thank you for your input. I believe I'm fit to be tied for this 11:59 due date, but regarding this method, my logic is as follows:  the matrix will be in a shape of (d,v) where d is num_docs and v is vocab_size. I believe it easy to instantiate an array of zeroes of that size, but from there, I would need to adequately loop through each w in v in d. A triple for loop as you mentioned. I have seen several mentions of for loops in this forum tonight, though I notice the Github README heavily disavows using for loops.   I wish reliance on a library we haven't used in this course was not so prevalent for this assignment, for I do not know any numpy methods that could perform that level of conditional counting at that iteration, not even a mask.  David,   You are correct. Please see my response to the answer above.  If (d,v) refers to the shape of your `term_doc_matrix` then you're on the right track! You'd only need a double-nested 'for' loop here, because you're only looping through two dimensions (a later function in MP3 uses three dimensions, though).  Honestly, I didn't see any major performance hit primarily using nested loops. The fastest code is the code that runs...write it to do what you need and worry about optimizing later. And if you're using nested loops, you don't need to know anything about `numpy` besides how to instantiate a matrix with zeroes - good luck! You've been a great help Seth, hopefully this time I've got it.   Thank you much!
Question on setting up MP 1 Hey friends,  I am following the steps in "[mp setup.pdf](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/Dzke2aP9TGC5Htmj_Sxgjg_59737a6e41dc41efae3c1c5ca47d5da2_mp-setup.pdf?Expires=1661299200&Signature=j2-82x7IQnd7nkD3sQutp5oQA3wiwriWkEVa2Pwnr3znpYV9vTYZ6ytgTj9F-oVN0z2\~gMnHZtOYcLMWhA-hbav6mfVDUeKxua0CkzrDda4e9HSyej9D2j88GpGIL2rZH6iexo5gi18mOvZr95TutrecYDPlY8o20uvtI8dG5uM_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)" but run into some issues. I am wondering for the step 6:  1\. Where do we enter the command of "*git clone --bare <git url>*"? Should we do into in git hub or terminal of laptop?  2\. Which git url should we use? The one from the private repo we created from step 1?  Also should we enter the command from step 7 in our local laptop's terminal?  Many thanks!  HanyinHi Hanyin, I think we need to do the cloning locally, so you'll have to use the terminal of your PC. The URL is https://github.com/CS410Fall2020/MP1.git, and all you need to do is type this on the terminal:  git clone --bare https://github.com/CS410Fall2020/MP1.git  Hope this helps!   In this case, we are free to use our own IDE such as **VS code** to do our homewrok.  Please note after some testing it appears the git url to be entered in step 6 should be: https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP1.git page not found error :(  Ah, I think they've updated the link. Try this instead: git clone --bare https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP1.git 
Due date for MP1 Hi, I saw this in the Github for MP1 "For students who just added the class, NO LATE PENALTY will be applied to submissions before Sept 11". Does anyone know who are "the students who just added the class"?  The dute date Sept 11 is for everyone?  Thanks. MingqingProbably it refers to the students who have enrolled for the class in last 1-2 days as they would still be waiting for coursera access. I have Sept 4th as the due date so doesn't look like Sep 11 timeline applies to everyone. I will need to confirm this with the instructor but no, the Sep 11 deadline is not for everyone. Usually it should be for students who got Coursera access very late.
Issue on Livedatalab I met some issues while following the setup pdf. 1). After I set up the webhook on my git account, I would find nothing in my 'project' on livedatalab page. Here is the screenshot below. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/18f5ca3d-ae5a-487a-a7bf-bed3b41b86bc/image.png) 2).

What is treated as a submission? Hi Kevin,  For curiosity I wanted to know why the my submission is showing the result as count of number of unique URLs instead of counting the number of different contexts being provided?  For example:  Query 1 --> Document 1 Query 2 --> Document 1 Query 3 --> Document 1  Query 4 --> Document 2 Query 5 --> Document 2  I see the total submissions being shown as 2. Is that expected?No sorry - that is not what I intended. In your example, I think the correct could should be 5, not 2. I'll fix this ASAP. Update: I've made the fix, total submissions should count each individual unique URL submitted. Thank you for prompt response!!
Issues with LiveDataLab Hi. I'm having issues with LiveDataLab account: - I cannot see any of the MPs. Under **Projects in this Course** for CS 410 it states "This course does not have any projects." - Webhook deliveries were never successful, including the initial ```ping```. The URL used is [http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger](url)  Additional information 1. The Personal access token created is shown as "Never used" while my LiveDataLab account is linked to Github 2. LiveDataLab is created with Illinois email id; Github is under my personal email 3. I recall creating an additional LiveDataLab account w/ Illinois email id a while ago. I forgot the password and attempted to re-sign up and was able to "reset" my password this way. This could have created duplicate accounts?  Can someone please take a look at my account and let me know how to fix it? Thank you.Me too. Just joined the class and the website for livedatalab told me This site can’t be reached Not sure if this is the case for everyone, but I've already submitted MP1 (been enrolled since first day of class), yet I'm seeing the same thing you are. My guess is this may have something to do with the server itself, maybe some sort of changes being done on the back-end?   I'm still seeing submission history though. My guess is this will probably have a resolution very soon. Just checked again actually and I can no longer access livedatalab at the moment as well, so you're definitely not alone. Similar as Raza, but I can still access livedatalab at this moment. I submitted my MP1 already and I can see my submission history.  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-30%20at%2011.34.36%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8af35920-d141-4fc3-9142-b279f4a49919/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-30%20at%2011.34.36%20AM.png) I am seeing same issue today.

Reviews assigned! Hi all,  Thank you for those who have accepted the CMT reviewer invitation email. If you haven't accepted yet, please do so ASAP.  I've now assigned the reviews. After logging into CMT and selecting role "Reviewer", you should see 2-3 papers. Clicking "Show Abstract" should give you the link to Github, which should contain the proposal. Clicking "Enter Review" will let you answer the review questions. For this stage, only ones that are marked [PROPOSAL] are necessary to fill out. For the others, you can put anything. Please try to complete the reviews by  October 30th.   I will be assigning new reviews daily to those who accept the invite late.   Best, Kevin
E-step  I have trouble getting the right output at E-step. What I did is for numerator, I  multiply document_topic_prob and self.topic_word_prob. For denominator I just did np.sum of the numerator. Then I normalize it. But I get this error. why? It seems my calculated output cannot be normalized![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-21%20at%2010.22.46%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/82f6c423-7f44-43e5-93a9-778a46ee6788/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-21%20at%2010.22.46%20PM.png)I suggest to test your algorithm on a smaller matrix and see if it gets what you want. i also had some errors like this. there could be a number of possible reasons. one thing i recommend is checking the shape of your matrices at various points.  another thing that helped me was that sometimes i found i had to index my 3-d numpy array like `[d][j][w]`, and sometimes i needed to use `[d,j,w]` -- the latter seeming especially important when indexing a slice like `[d,:,w]`...there may be a formal reason for this in numpy, as most cases online seem to use that method: https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_array_slicing.asp https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4257394/slicing-of-a-numpy-2d-array-or-how-do-i-extract-an-mxm-submatrix-from-an-nxn-ar My guess is you were trying to normalize a 1-dimension array with the given `normalize` function? If so, `normalize` function assumes input is a 2-dimension matrix.
Is there a practice exam for exam1? Question as aboveNo. However, the exam should be similar to the quizes

Has the link problem been solved or not? I am not sure which link to use.Please try **livelab** instead of **livedatalab** I have tried and it's still working. this:http://livelab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger is working for me (X). Edited: Neither of the URLs is working. This url is not working for me either.  I am getting the same warning as above.  Hopefully this will get ironed out with #21  Sorry, it now shows error for me as well. Are you still getting an error? The webhook URL is: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger. Please make sure you are selecting application/json as the Content Type. Hey Priyanka,  I am still getting this error after using the link you provided and selecting application/json content type. ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-22%20at%208.58.06%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/383878de-dbd9-49e0-94ec-24ee21657df2/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-22%20at%208.58.06%20PM.png) What is the error you are receiving?

I linked a new account with my github login email and this new account replaced the old linked account. then I tried the above link: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger and it's still not working. Can you please share a screenshot of your webhook config and the error you are getting?  I still see this the same error as above: Last delivery was not successful. failed to connect to host.

I was mixing up the new and old links each time I started over so I was getting a bunch of different results.

I re-entered the information with "github.com", my github username, and the API key (use plain text- not sure if this matters but thats what I did). Add the linked account. Then I deleted the webhook config on github and added a new one with the correct link (http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger). This fixed the issue for me. Posted on answer above! Thank you! I finally add the webhook successfully! I have used the URL: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger. I also left the security blank. You might have to delete the existing webhook and create a new one. Once created, give it a minute to establish the communication. After doing this, mine shows green check-mark. 
LiveDataLab Forgot Password Hi,  Looks like I have forgotten password for LiveDataLab.  Can somebody advice what the next step is? I just signed up again. Will this be a problem?Have you signed up with the same email address? If so, you shouldn't have any issues. give 1 like because it cracks me up XD Yes. I have signed up with the same email address, however I am facing another problem as mentioned in the post #1136 . Thank you for the help!
Issue with MP1 Hi, when I click on the "open tool" button of MP1, an error shows up. Seems TA may have answered in a previous post:  *Hi there, please try the following link: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/course/join/WZS77P00E570J74*  *You should also see MP1 available now.*   ``` ``` Just wanted to leave a note for anyone else going through this LiveDataLab/Github process.  The MP1 "Open Tool" button is broken.  The address above will allow you to continue with the instructions given in the MP setup doc.  The next step will be to select the "Project" nav bar tab.  
MP2.2 Judgments Hello,  I did two queries and at least 10 judgments for each query, but it shows my submitted judgments are only 3, any ideas?   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6357cd7b-4f6f-446b-9015-ee932c5940e6/image.png)It seems the system only records the number of queries, not the judgments, please confirm. It is 5 searches, 10 clicks (relevant, not relevant) each, so 50 clicks. As per my understanding, the system is recording only the number of queries I agree with our classmates. It only means you did 3 searches. The counter will not tell you how many judgements you give for each search. I did 6 searches (for each I have more than 10 judgements submitted) and for me the number is 6.  Yes sorry - that number is the number of judged queries, not the total number of judged results. When I get a chance, I'll update the UI to make this clearer. And to receive full credit for the assignment, that number should be >= 5.  I think we should submit >= judgments with at least 10 relevant results each and the number of relevant results will not show on this page. Seems it hasn't been updated yet? Yes, your understanding is correct it only counts the number of query submission (and doesn't count /display) the judgement for each query.
About the probabilistic model Hi everyone. p(R = 1 | q, d) is approximated using the query likelihood, p(q | d). I wonder why not using the document likelihood, p(d | q). That is, the probability of a document given a query. I think this is more meaningful. Thanks!It might because  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ad101542-8d63-45d0-b241-0ecf4f30e7e3/image.png)  From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_likelihood_model Great, thanks for the answer! In my mind, One of the reasonings behind exploring the probability of a query given a document p(q|d) is the challenge behind getting the relevant document given the size of the internet. p(q|d) model explores on extrapolating on the probabilistic retrieval model by thinking there is a imaginary document that exists and has a certain content , how would user formulate a query given language model approach, more like a reverse engineering approach.  Thanks for the insight.   I agree that p(q | d) is much easier to estimate. But for p(d | q), smoothing is impracticable using a “query collection”. So Bayes’ theorem is used here.  Just to add to the answers given by others, in the query likelihood model, we think of this question "If a user is thinking of this document, how likely is the user going to pose the given query Q?" Document likelihood, i.e, the probability of a document given a particular query is definitely another possible approach. But what makes query likelihood convenient is that since queries are small and documents are big, we assume that the query is generated from the words in the document. Predicting the probability of a large document based on a small query is much more difficult. Thanks Harita for explaining this!
Proposal Submission via GitHub Hello, I just wanted to confirm that we are supposed to add our Project Proposal to our forked Course Project GitHub repo only, correct? We have to create a CMT account and update it with the link to our project repository, but we are not adding the proposal to CMT, right? Thank you.I believe that's the correct understanding. The Last point in the CMT Submission doc mentions it.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/213b5be7-d4de-4f51-9d52-72124afe47e4/image.png) Yes, this is correct! You will add all project content to your GitHub, which will be linked in the abstract submission on CMT.
Have installed metapy, but "import metapy still can not be resolved" in visual studio I think I have successfully installed Metapy.![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/0f11a166-6dc0-470d-b506-46d1aecaf5f8/image.png) But, in the VSC, it is still has error.![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b1929992-cd4e-4f96-a391-74af38454419/image.png) "tok" and "trigrmas" are not defined. Is this normal because I havent finished the code? Or, my installation has some problems. ThanksYou need to define tok and trigrams in the portion above. Starting at line 7 (‘’’Place your code here’’’) you’ll add your own code to complete the assignment, and you’ll define these variables in doing so You need to initialize these 2 objects in your function. The metapy analyzers functions will return your "tok" and "trigrams". Then the following code can use these 2 obj to finish the work. You can refer to the MP1 readme where you can find all you need to complete this assignment. Even I was unable to get metapy to install correctly on my computer. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy works natively there. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153  
Lesson 2.5: Compressing Document Ids On slide 5 out of 7 of the Lesson 2.5 slides, we are told that the differences between consecutive document IDs of tuples describing the number of occurrences of a specific term in different documents are likely to be small, and that this allows us to compress. Why are these differences likely to be small? I did not understand the explanation in the video,We expect the distribution of words in collections to follow Zipf's Law. This means that the distribution of terms is quite skewed. Though the most frequent words occur quite a lot, if we reserve these as stop words and remove them during the parsing step, then we can expect our specific terms to occur much more rarely. Because these rare terms occur less often, their counts are smaller, so we expect to see smaller integer numbers there. Even if we do not remove the stop words, I believe since there are far fewer stop words than rare words (in terms of count of unique terms), then there will also be fewer large numbers than small numbers. A large number occasionally is fine for something like $$\gamma$$ encoding or moreso for $$\delta$$ encoding That's not answering my question. You are talking about the compression of term frequencies, not about the compression of document ids. i see, sorry i misread. in that case, the document id's are stored via `d-gap`; you subtract the document id that a term appears ($$d_i$$) in by the document id that the term last appeared in ($$d_{i - 1}$$). then you store those `d-gap` differences. there are thus two cases for when we are indexing document ids that a term occurs in: 1. the term is a very common word that occurs a lot of the time; so it occurs in a lot of documents. in this case, we expect the `d-gap` to be small for the documents it occurs in (since we are accessing sequentially). this is the most frequent case by far, again according to Zipf's law 2. the term is a rare word and only occurs in a few documents. in this case, it is possible we get a large `d-gap` value. however, this is rare and won't happen much, since only a  few documents contain this query term to begin with  So we can leverage this skew in the term distributions when compressing values here as well  Please let me know if that clarified things or if I misunderstood again, and apologies for the confusion!  Okay, thank you. Hi guys. I am confused about the term in d-gap. Should a specific term be considered in d-gap? Could you offer me a simple example of d-gap? Hi guys. I think I have understood d-gap. I noticed that compression is implemented for postings. Thanks!
Lesson 4.5 - Formula question Hello TA,  For lesson 4.5, the formula in the video is different from the one in the slide, may I know which one is correct?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/9c4b88ee-5376-412f-b8db-044bcf76f2a8/image.png)  ThanksThe issue with the first formula is that there is $$c(w,q)$$ even though w is not defined. If it was $$\sum_{w\epsilon V, c(w,d)>0}c(w,q)log\frac{p_{seen}(w|d)}{\alpha_{d}p(w|C)}$$, it would have been correct because we are considering the count of words in the query. $$\sum_{w\epsilon V, c(w,d)>0}c(w,q)log\frac{p_{seen}(w|d)}{\alpha_{d}p(w|C)}$$ is equivalent to $$\sum_{w_{i}\epsilon d, w_{i}\epsilon q}log\frac{p_{seen}(w_{i}|d)}{\alpha_{d}p(w_{i}|C)}$$ in the formula on the second picture.  Hello Harita,   Thanks for the answer! It seems like they are equivalent when $$c(w,q)$$ is equal to 1 for all $$w$$ under $$q$$ only to me, if $$c(w,q) > 1$$, they will be not equivalent, is that correct? It looks like the slides have skipped some relevant context. I would suggest looking at the formula in page 120 and 121 in the textbook.  ![Screenshot%202022-09-08%20at%2012.56.48%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/bd591fce-abda-4dae-967c-1a4521673a49/Screenshot%202022-09-08%20at%2012.56.48%20PM.png) ![Screenshot%202022-09-08%20at%2012.56.57%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e1bbcb11-54d8-4a34-913e-989341def89e/Screenshot%202022-09-08%20at%2012.56.57%20PM.png) 
MP2.1 - Linking Specific PDF Page via DL Extension - Not working Dears,  I was trying to see if I can link a specific PDF page while adding searchable content via DL Extension (as per the given instructions), but it seems the extension is not able to understand the #page=<pageno.> in the link as shown below:  **Snapshot 1: Linking the Page by giving the "#page=111" at the end.** ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b458c659-cfc0-4a8e-b85c-c5b25942a24d/image.png)  **Snapshot 2: The Link created is not tagged with "#page=111" at the end.** ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e05e03f8-093f-457d-81bf-1ba31a3b9cd2/image.png)  When I open the above link it opens the PDF from Page 1 instead of directly going to Page 111. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, appreciate your input.  Thanks, AyushThanks for noticing this! From the backend, it looks like the page fragment in the URL is being stored, so you're doing it correctly. I'll look into fixing this error.   In the meantime, please feel free to still add specific PDF pages. Alright, this error should be fixed! I checked your example, and it opens to page 111 now.   Also, one thing to note: The URL for the first (non-indented) link in your example will NOT have the fragment, because it is meant to be a pointer to the entire resource. However, the second (indented) link, which is meant to point to specific submissions, will have the pdf page fragment.  Thanks, Kevin for your quick help on this. I'm now able to link specific PDF pages. Appreciate your help. Wonderful! Glad that it works on your end
Where to Put Tech Review? Sorry for asking so many questions about this, but where do we put the file "techreview.pdf"? Directly in the downloaded repository? Within the tech_review folder (so /tech_review/tech_review)?I think you can just put it in the /tech_review/ folder. If that doesn't work put it in both the root level dir and the /tech_review/ dir.  You can tell whether or not the autograder found your file by clicking "Leaderboard" and seeing if your score is a 0 or a 1. I have not submitted the PDF yet and mine is a 0. You can see others have a 1. ![Untitled.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/01a41772-6b73-4228-9337-402b39271915/Untitled.jpg)  A TA can answer more direct, but I don't see putting it in two places hurting anything.
Decode gamma code  Can anyone please give an example of how to decode a gamma code?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4a427f4e-6e29-4978-b7d2-654ae48c23f3/image.png)Lets decode 1110010  K+1 = 1110 K+1 = 4 K = 3 (which is floor(log2 X); we are calculating X)  Now 010, remaining bits are in binary So R = 010 binary = 2 decimal   X = 2^K + R = 2^3 + 2 = 10  Hope this helps. That helps, thanks! Hitesh Yadav gave an example, but I would like to say that it might be good to try and convert the answer you got back into gamma code and see if it equals the provided gamma code, in order to make sure that you did not make any mistakes.  Likewise, when asked to convert a number into gamma code, you could try to convert it back into a number to check for errors. The easiest way to decode (inverse) gamma is to replace the unary prefix with a 1.  Steps: - discard the unary prefix, which is everything up to and including the first 0  - prepend a 1 to the remainder   Example:  $$ 1110010 \quad (\gamma   \text{ encoded})\to 1110 \mid 010 \to 1 \mid 010 \to 1010 \quad (\text{binary encoded}) $$

Question about CMT platform It appears I have to manually search for our course in the "All conferences" list. Is there a way I can add the course to "My conference" list to make it easier to access? (Google didn't seem to help me)  Thanks!You can try to remove some characters from the query. For example just type "CS410", our conference will show up. For your second point, I also want to know the answer.
Can we choose any task if we plan to make a Leaderboard Competition? For the [CS 410 Project Topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-EagO17Og7_ESj5hkP5x4EFrVPQAtBlH9YvsgEzjnY/edit) guide, under Leaderboard Competitions it says "You can create a competition on any task that is interesting to you." Does this mean we can make competitions which are not directly relevant to the course material?  Thanks for the clarification.The proposed leaderboard competition should be relevant to the course material or to the general theme of the course (information retrieval, language modeling, etc.). If you are unsure, please feel free to send me the topic(s) that you're interested in and we can have a discussion.  Thanks, I was thinking of creating a competition for the task of identifying sarcasm in news articles (like The Onion, for an extreme example) based on the headline and the contents of the article itself. It's in the realm of text but it's more of a sentiment analysis/classification problem than what we've been doing in the course so far. Do you think this would be an appropriate topic for the project? Yes, that would be an appropriate topic for the project!
LiveData not updating Hi,  I linked my LiveData lab account with my GitHub account and the Webhook in my private repo also shows recent deliveries from when I pushed my code (also tried redelivering the payloads). However, it's been over 20 minutes and the grading script doesn't seem to have completed.. I don't see any recent submissions on LiveData lab or a score on Coursera. Livedata lab also says that I have not started any projects. Not sure if I'm missing something?Same thing is happening to me. Actually, I had this for the webhook address `http://livelab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger`, when it should be `http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger`. Works for me now. Hmm, yeah I used the updated webhook link. Not sure why it’s not linking the two as it should  This may be due to the server instability. You can try to resubmit it at another time. Or you can check the generated logs as this might also be caused by the incorrect codes. I think the problem is with the PAT. I deleted linked accounts on LiveData lab, regenerated the PAT, and linked again. However, I see "Never Used" next to the CS410 PAT on GitHub, so I don't think it was properly read in by LiveData lab. Any recommendations? Can I link my account a different way? it is not working for me , can someone please help. Did you get it work? As Priyanka can see your netid in the leaderboard. No, still not working If possible, can you take screenshots and create a new post explaining your issue? Thanks! Done..post is #94
General MP question I always have trouble setting up environments.  Would it ever be possible to put everything you need to get the MPs up and running in a container?  I just don't have any experience with this.  Thanks!!Have you tried the setup and faced any issues? The process is mentioned step-by-step in the instructions. I got it working.  No worries!! It is more along the lines of installing Python 3.5, making sure that Python 3.5 opens instead of Python 3.9, getting pip to work correctly, etc.  Environment variables, etc. I wound up just making a conda environment, but this took a little bit of doing. Thank you!
MP3: log-likelihoods decreasing, but consistently Getting an interesting result with my log likelihoods at the end of each iteration, and the algorithm doesn't converge in the default 50 iterations.  My log-likelihoods are negative (as I'd expect) and decreasing, but decreasing by a consistent amount (roughly 1200). The algorithm does not converge after 50 iterations and ends in the -58,000 range.  Questions that'll hopefully point me in the right direction...  * should this algorithm converge within 50 iterations to pass the autograder?   * is -58,000 (approx). in the right ballpark for a log likelihood after 50 iterations?  * what should normalization look like in the expectation step? This is where I currently suspect I'm having issues - shouldn't each document/vocab word pair be normalized across all topics?  * Guessing that LiveDataLab uses a different implementation of `main` since I'm seeing 300 iterations in those logs...does it also use the `DBLP.txt` input file rather than `test.txt`?im answering from my understanding and looking at my results:  1. not necessarily; i believe this might depend on a few things, including the results of your random initialization 2. i had different results than that, again that may be related to random initializations 3. i recommend #1132 as a helpful visual for this. generally, when you want to normalize a distribution, you can coerce that distribution at add up to 1. the reason this works is because when you $$\sum{x \in X}$$ and set that equal to 1 it adds an implicit denominator to all the term; see https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/278418/normalize-values-to-sum-1-but-keeping-their-weights reference the `softmax` function; fundamentally you are making sure that for every `$$k$$ topic, you normalize $$p(Z_{dw = j})$$  tp 1 4. i think it does and maybe even with hidden inputs but im not sure here Got things working a couple hours after this, figured I'd answer my own questions in case anyone else runs into similar issues -  * doesn't necessarily have to converge within 50 iterations for `test.txt` to pass the autograder (mine finally converged in ~150 iterations and then passed the autograder in ~25 iterations)  * log likehoods are pretty meaningless by themselves (it'll depend a lot on how you preprocess the input...for example, I wasn't parsing out the \t token in `test.txt` to begin with), don't look at their values, just their values and deltas in comparison to other iterations  * normalization is definitely needed in the E step, learned that the hard way after some crazy likelihoods and ultimately divide-by-zero errors :)  * seems like yes, different implementation of main for the autograder, so changing `main` locally doesn't matter and can be useful for testing Thank you! Finally got this working and came to similar conclusions - stumbled onto #1132 as well, super helpful great! glad you got it working I was also in this situation. What worked for me was to double check if variables in the E step and M step were updated correctly. same issue ,my E step was wrong
Quiz question I still don't understand this question:  Question 7 Which of the following is NOT correct about the unigram model?  1 / 1 point  1. The probability of generating the word sequence "A" "B" "C" is the same as generating "C" "B" "A."   2. The probability of generating the word A OR B is the sum of the probability of generating A and the probability of generating B.   3.  The probability of generating the words A AND B is the product of the probability of generating A and the probability of generating B.  I would think answer 2 is true.  If I am picking the first word of a sentence out of a bag of words, the chance that I pick A or B is p(A)+ P(B).  They are independent.This is my understanding: Query likely hood model (probabilistic language model) defines what is the probability of user entering a query that is likely to match a document. As we assume that each outcome is independent, the probability of a sequence of outcomes is calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities.  For example what is the likelihood of user entering the query that contains "Presidential" and "Campaign" in the query. Both of these are independent keywords but what is the probability of user entering them together that matches the document. P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) Would love to get insight if the above is incorrect. Feel free to mark it as unresolved.  Thank you Hitesh.  I agree with everything you say.  My problem is that the key gives choice 2 above as false.  I think it is true.  Sorry to not be clear.  I asked this question a few weeks ago, and the response was that #2 is incorrect because we should subtract the intersection of A & B.  I don't understand that if picking A and B are independent.   Thank you!!  I am not sure why we would intersect the words (probability wise). I think intersection might not apply in Unigram as we are only predicting one word at a time. There is no dependency or interaction between the words while predicting probability of the word. Exactly! Hi Frank, p(A or B) = p(A) + p(B) applies if A and B are mutually exclusive, i.e., if we know for a fact that A and B are different words. I think we cannot assert that, since every unigram word is independently chosen. Then we're left with the more general formulation, which is p(A or B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A ∩ B).  I hope this helps.    That is it!  Thank you David!!  It never occurred to me that A could equal B.  If this is the case, you can only pull it from the bag once.  Very tricky!
MP 2.1 Start Date Hi, I see that MP 2.1 is open on Coursera, can we start working on it? Is MP 2.1 finalized ? I am still not able to access the sign up sheet though.  Thank you. ![Screenshot%202022-09-05%20at%202.38.58%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/561d4259-d2e8-46ae-836f-5770ef0ddcf9/Screenshot%202022-09-05%20at%202.38.58%20PM.png)I can access the doc after logging into G Suite with my illinois.edu email  How did you get your G Suite account?

Colab Options If you are still having troubles configuring metapy on your local machine and you would like to try Colab, this will help you get started.  First, add this in a code cell at the top of your Colab notebook and run it:  ``` !pip install metapy pytoml ``` Now you have two options:  Option A: - Write and test all the assignment code in the traditional interactive notebook format using multiple code and text cells - When done, comment out the pip install line  ``` # !pip install metapy pytoml ``` - File > Download > Download .py to download `example.py`   Option B: - Create a second code cell and put this cell magic statement at the top ``` %%writefile example.py ``` - Write all the assignment code in that single code cell  - To test, you can either comment out the magic statement, or you can add a third code cell with this line magic to run the output script: ``` %run example.py ``` - When done, manually download `example.py` from the files tab on the left side of Colab Thank you for sharing this. I found another post very helpful. I believe these really help folks who are having issues with installing metapy on their machine.  I would just add that once you have tested the code, push it to the git which automatically runs it and update livedatalab with the result.
MP3 reference links Has anyone been able to access or download the references mentioned in the MP3 instructions?  I get an "unable to connect" error even when logged in to UIUC and connected through the UIUC VPN.  The references are: [1]	[Cheng’s note](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/czhai/pub/em-note.pdf) on the EM algorithm   [2]	[Chase Geigle’s note](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/course/598f16/notes/em-algorithm.pdf) on the EM algorithm, which includes a derivation of the EM algorithm (see section 4), and   [3]	[Qiaozhu Mei’s note](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/course/598f16/plsa-note.pdf) on the EM algorithm for PLSA, which includes a different derivation of the EM algorithm.See #843  I engaged the TA's in the comments of that discussion, and they never got back to me. Dave, thank you very much for the link to Professor Zhai's note. Following your lead, I found papers by Chase Geigle, but it's not clear which one (if any) is the one intended for us. Was that your experience also? Yeah, that's as far as I got. I've been following up trying to find him for `metapy` project work (he's a maintainer of the project) and even the course staff can't get in touch. I don't think there's much hope that it gets resolved. Hi sorry for the confusion, I thought the links were being accessed from the Github repo: https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP3  I've updated the links there, and they work on my end. Thank you, Kevin! I can see the papers now. Links in the MP3 instructions are pulling from locations other than "timan".
how do I submit mp2.3 I think I am overlooking some instructions somewhereI think the way to submit MP2.3 is the same as MP1.  Programming Assignments Overview: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/irzBO/programming-assignments-overview  Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/026Fl/mp2-3  GitHub: https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP2.3 Yes, its similar to MP1. File search_eval.py has to be modified to incorporate the asked functionality in the assignment. Also, need to create a txt file named significance.txt with just the p-value.  Both the files have to be added to Github using the same steps as done in MP1.  Thank you both!
MP2.4 Coursera LiveDataLab link expire Hi,  I tried accessing the LiveDataLab link on Coursera (the blue button) and it's already expired. Please fix.  P.S.: Also on LiveDataLab, 2.4 github is not released.  Thank you,Could you elaborate on what you mean by the link "expired"? Is there a specific error/issue that you are seeing? The link seems to open up a web page with an error webpage not available. Have you tried clicking on it? I think MP2.4 has not been released yet. We were targeting to release it on Sep 21. Oh okay. Thank you
Unable to access sign up sheet of MP 2.1 Hi, the sign-up sheet of MP 2.1 is stating that I need access even though I logged in with my Illinois id.   Thanks for advice. Thanks for reporting the problem. I'm sorry that we have prematurely made MP2.1 available to you, causing the problem you've encountered. MP2.1 was scheduled to be released a bit later, and we are still working on testing the whole MP2, including MP2.1, which will be different from what you've seen in the current description as we will ask you to use an alternative way for collecting content so as to eliminate the need for the sign-up sheet. So please wait a bit until we officially release MP2.1. We'll post a note here to let you know once it's officially released and available for you to work on. 
Practice Quiz 5 random jumping ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/55877ca2-c384-4508-bf83-c6a63f13652b/image.png)  May I ask why the answer is this one? How about other two choices?I'll go through these one by one to discuss how they relate to PageRank's random jumping in inverse order:  1. *Otherwise disconnected page has zero probability*: This is a problem that random jumping *does* help solve; imagine a completely disconnected page. Without any incoming links, there is no way to follow a link to reach this node. Thus, without random jumps the probability of reaching this node is 0. Adding random jumping means this node will have some probability to be reached no matter what node you are currently on, solving this issue. So, this is not an answer for this question, since it *is* a benefit of introducing random jumping 2. *Otherwise for zero-outlink nodes will receive all the probability*: Without random jumping, if you end up in a node that has no outlinks, you will get stuck there. You have zero probability of traversing to any other node. Random jumping introduces probability that you will go to another random node even when in this situation, thus mitigating this issue. Since random jumping does solve this issue, this is also not an answer to the question 3. *Otherwise PageRank will favor nodes with fewer incoming links*: Without random jumping, nodes with fewer incoming links will be reached less often, since it is less likely to reach them at most time steps. So PageRank will *not* favor nodes with fewer incoming links. With random jumping, nodes with fewer incoming links may actually be reached *more* frequently, since there will always be some non-zero probability to reach that node. So, not only is this not a problem with PageRank in general, but random jumping also does the opposite of what this option suggests. So, this is *not* a benefit of introducing random jumping, and is the correct answer for this question  Please let me know if that made sense, I am happy to go into more detail, especially around how PageRank and random jumping work If random jumping is not there, nodes with no outgoing links will get all prob. bcuz, if the control reaches that node, we can not go out of that node. But, random jumping helps here. If random jumping is not there, nodes that do not have incoming links will not be parsed at all. Thus, random jumping helps in ensuring that disconnected pages do get some prob. Thus, second and third options are valid. But, first option is the opposite. Without random jumping, PageRank generally pushes down pages with fewer incoming links. So, neither is the reasoning correct nor does PageRank play a role in first option here. 
Confused about MP2.3 Hello, I'm a little unsure if I'm doing MP2.3 correctly. I feel like I understand what is needed, but I'm not an expert in python so I don't know how to approach some issues. First, this is how I updated the score_one function. Am I on the right track of what is needed here? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e2e56643-f595-4675-a9f6-4eac7d71e241/image.png)Then do I just modify the load_ranker function like this:   return InL2Ranker(metapy.index.RankingFunction) ?  Then I get stuck on how to create two txt files, one for BM25 and another for InL2. The instructions give the below code under the "Varying a parameter" section and say to modify this to create the txt files.

1. You are on track for the score_one function. I did not check in details for your formula but you can try push, if it is correct you get 70% points.  2.inside the inl2ranker() you have to put parameter=certain number)  3.when it says modify it means change the ranker parameter to another function just like it shows in the snippet. Once you run both code, you get 225 results, you copy paste them into two separate .txt file and read them in as float array, then run the statistical comparison to get p-value Yes you need to modify the scoring function in score_one.  And for the txt files, I think you may just copy the lists of printed scores by calling BM25 and InL2 into two seperate txt files, then read the values from the two files and compute the p value. This part is not given in search_eval.py so I guess you'll need to add this part yourself (either in search_eval.py or outside of it)  Initially, I did my scipy.stats.ttest_rel(a, b) with avg_p list variables.  After realizing you actually needed the text files, I used my empty list a variable to append the avg_p per ranker and ouput it to a file like the code below:  ``` with open(r'C:/~/~/MP2.3_CS410_private/inl2.avg_p.txt', 'w') as fp:         for item in a:             fp.write('%s\n'% item) ```  Do it for both rankers and you should be on track.  Hope this helps! Just wanted to say thank you cus i realized that use the wrong variable for c(t, D). After modify it I got a 0.7, so i guess your score_one is correct. Thank you so much! I think I was overthinking this assignment and didn't realize that I was on track with the first part. I had to fix my webhooks and then I got 70% for the score_one function. Then I was able to get the 225 results for each function and find the p-value. Your comment helped guide me in the right direction! Thank you! It took me some time to figure out how to read the values from the txt files into arrays to calculate the p-value, but once that was done, I was getting full score. Thank you so much! This really helped me. I was stuck on how to read in the values from each function. That's awesome, glad I could help!
MP2.4 1 on Leaderboard but 0% in Coursera Hello, I noticed that I beat the baseline score with my submission, but I still have a 0% in the Coursera for MP2.4. Any idea as to why this is?Same here. Showing score 1 in leaderboard but 0% in Coursera. May be TAs  can help
Week 1 Lecture 1.4 In Lecture 1.4, it is mentioned that the key idea behind probabilistic inference model is to associate uncertainty to inference rules. Shouldn't it be certainty instead ? Is this a typo? It would be great if someone could provide more info regarding this concept. Thanks!Probabilistic Inference model associates probability that a function will take value 1 or 0. So looks like it should be 'associating certainty(or probability) to inference rules'. For details can refer to http://deepdive.stanford.edu/inference With probabilistic models, given that what you quantify is the standard error/deviation, I could see how this could be considered “associating uncertainty”. Like with true/false, I think it’s an equivalent formulation to state it either way.
MP2.4 success rate I am trying various ranking algorithms for MP2.4, without that much success to date. It's a little demoralising to see that no one has actually passed the baseline yet, including people who have submitted dozens of times. What is the baseline? Is it far above what is being achieved by the leaders?According to the TA in #583, the baseline is about 0.7, but another student posted that the TAs told them there might be a bug causing current scores for the faculty dataset to be extremely low. I tried about 90 submissions yesterday before they reset the leaderboard with different permutations of BM25, JM, etc., as well as combination of multiple rankers, but never exceeded ~0.16. At this point, I'm not quite sure where to go from here, so I'm just going to wait to see if somebody is able to discover success. Same here, have tried multiple times. Will wait for update from TAs to see if the baseline is modified  The bug for me is that my **faculty score** is very low like less than 0.0006 regardless what parameters are used. Also the baseline should be adjusted.  I got an answer from a TA. For now, the TAs are working on fixing the problems: 1. some mistakes in the dataset 2. recalculate the baseline score  They will let us know once it is done. So maybe we should pause for now. Yes, I should have specified. Agreed, my maximum faculty dataset score was 0.00079, and even wild parameter variations could hardly get it to budge more than +/-0.0001 Same here, multiple tries.
MP 2.3: c(t, Q), c(t, C), and c(t, D) In the equations for MP 2.3, what do the following values represent? - c(t, Q) - c(t, C) - c(t, D)  Thank you!You will have to replace them with the correct variables from the sd object file that is linked to the MP2.3 assignment. c(t, Q) = count of the term in the query c(t, C) = count of the term in the collection c(t, D) = count of the term in the document  all of these can be extracted from the `sd` object, and there is helpful documentation for what accessors you have there, though some of the terms have a bit of different descriptions Thank you but I am wondering how to find c(t, Q)[Is that query_term_weight?] and c(t, C)? Since there is no apparent information for these two parts in score data. for this i reference #598  which also links to [this documentation](https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html)  one way to "weight" a query term is by its count in the query  i also recommend thinking about your `corpus`, and what it represents in this case, especially compared with the above documentation  please let me know if that made sense

MP 2.3 Failure on LiveDataLab HI, I keep getting a failure on Livedatalab for mp 2.3, and I am not sure why. The logs never appeared to tell me why, and it has been over a day since I pushed and still no logs appeared. How do I find out what went wrong with my code? Thanks.  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%206.59.46%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/00a7626d-3383-4455-bc6d-40754c38edc1/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%206.59.46%20PM.png)  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%206.59.43%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/b3242efd-c00d-4898-b6c1-3472c399a3b9/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-21%20at%206.59.43%20PM.png)Did you get the result from the local? Nothing went wrong locally. It ran just fine  Be really careful about C(t, x), they are three different implementations.  see post #501  I had problems with print statements hanging up the grader I just commented out all my print statements, and I already had created a significance.txt for testing purposes and I just put a random value in it. The submission still resulted in a FAILURE, and logs showed up. I just don't even know why it is coming out as FAILURE.   For reference, I added logic in the score_one function and did return InL2Ranker(some_param=1.0) in the load_ranker function. I haven't modified any of the other code yet for Varying the parameter except commenting out the print statements this is not the issue. Like my issue is that the livedatalab just completely fails to read my code for some reason Resolved. I just deleted my linked accounts in LiveDataLab and generated a new personal access token and linked my github account with the new personal access token and pushed again and that worked.
Any installation guide for python 3.5 I'm using windows 11  I have tried install ubuntu and it is using python 3.10. I tried the  pip install metapy pytoml but it failed. So I think I need help on how to properly install python 3.5.  I was having the issue and the default python version my computer uses is python 3.9. What I did is to create a virtual Conda environment and set the python version to be 3.5 and then you should be able to run python programs in that environment using python 3.5 I am on Windows 11 as well. Uninstall Python 3.10 and install 3.5 version. here is the link - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/   you can install the executable installer and then follow the pdf instructions , it should work !  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/70c656d1-d2b7-4626-836d-4c8d6b225321/image.png) You can download Anaconda and create a new environment with Python 3.5 I found the answer in post #28 very helpful I installed anaconda and created a virtual environment with python=3.5, under this environment, I can move a little further. Thanks!  This is the right answer, except create an environment using Python 3.5, not Python 3.7 (which is what the post says).
Practice Quiz Q4 We are asked "Which of the following application scenario in text retrieval relies LESS on NLP?" The possible answers are "compare homework submissions from students to check if plagiarism occurs" and "Use query in English to retrieve documents in French". The correct answer is "Compare homework submissions from students to check if plagiarism occurs".  Why is this the case? In the second case, couldn't you just translate each word in the query and treat it as a bag of words? That would be fairly shallow NLP. However, in the first case, your application must have a deep understanding of each sentence in order to tell if two students wrote the same thing, as they are unlikely to copy word for word.The question asks which one relies **less** on NLP. Translation (from English to French) relies more on NLP than comparison in the same langauge. BOW will be sufficient in the second case. I think the translation itself could involve some NLP technique like a transformer This is the correct explanation.

LiveDataLab web session/logout issues Is anybody else having issues with their web session on LiveDataLab? I frequently get returned the the login page while trying to navigate to or refresh the MP 2.4 leaderboard. Once logged back in, I'm taken to the landing page rather than the page I was trying to access, with a good chance that I'll get logged out again while trying to navigate back to where I was.I have not faced exactly the same issue. However, I do get frequently returned to the login page after almost 10-15 refresh to MP2.4 leaderboard
Submission of the proposal Hello TAs,  Just wish to make sure only one submission by the group leader is needed for the proposal. From this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFvippp_jyiUUXpWsps4Geh5KsyZRkJq/edit) it appears to be the case, however in Coursera it says "*Only the group leader needs to enter the project topic. However, every student needs to enter all other details*." Not sure what are the "other details" rest of group members need to enter.  Many thanks.By other details, I think they are referring to the google doc https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmeAR8uMgTGbVHFwzw4UAvkFpW6ldEWO4hZt-RApO9c/edit#gid=0 Every member needs to fill that out with their name and email address. TA's can confirm The "other details" was referring to the name, group name, etc. on the Google sheet.  For the proposal submission on CMT, only the group leader needs to make the submission. But make sure that all members sign up for CMT and the respective account emails are added when making the submission. 
Week 8 - Quiz - Question 5 can someone help explain the concept in this question   ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/3682a96b-d4d1-4c0b-88ab-7eee463e9607/image.png)Think of "the" as a coin that is lands face-up 98% of the time and face-down 2% of the time. "Celestial" is a coin that lands face-up 2% of the time and face-down 98% of the time. The uncertainty of these two coins would be same. entropy, ($$H(X)$$) is a way to measure the randomness of variable `X`. see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtebGVx-Fxw) for a much more detailed look at entropy.  the common way to describe this concept is with a coin flip. there are two extremes to consider.  1. a perfectly balanced coin that has $$P(X="heads") = P(X = "tails") = 0.5$$ 2. a completely biased coin that shows only either heads or tails (let's pick heads for now): $$P(X="heads") = 1$$  if we want to encode the "randomness" of this coin flip, we may first notice that option 2 isn't really all that "random". there is one outcome that will happen with 100% probability. so, if we wanted to measure the "randomness" of this, what would you want the measure to look like? thinking it through, we'd probably want the "randomness" of this case to be 0 -- there is nothing random here, it is pre-determined. In fact, Entropy for this case is just that: $$H(X) = 0$$ in this case.  for the first case (1), the result is actually random. in fact, for entropy $$H(X) = 1$$ in this case. one way that is handy for me to think about this is "how many bits are needed to encode the possibilities?" in a case of a perfectly balanced coin, you need two possibilities to be fully represented -- heads and tails (1 or 0). this leads to 1 bit, or $$H(X) = 1$$. though, you can have measures of entropy in between 0 and 1 as well: for example a "partially biased coin" that lands on heads 98% of the time and tails 2% of the time. also note that the entropy curve is symmetric; as David says a coin that lands on heads 98% of the time is just as random as a coin that lands on tails 98% of the time  but basically, the less random something is the smaller the entropy. the more random, the more entropy. also, it is helpful to remember the equation for entropy:  $$H(X) = \sum_{v \in {0,1}}-p(x = v)log_2p(x =v)$$ As per my understanding, Entropy is the representation of the uncertainty in the outcome.   With the word 'the' we are almost certain that it will occur most of the time. Similarly, with the word 'celestial' we are almost certain that it will not occur most of the time. As the level of certainty is similar for both the words, they both have the same entropy.  Thank you very helpful ! thank you ! thank you
Quiz answers Will we be able to see the correct answers to the quiz after the deadline has passed?Have you tried the "View Feedback" button on the bottom right of the quiz screen in Coursera?   That just shows which questions I got right and which are wrong. I can't see what the correct answer for the wrong ones is. Can you see that also? I see, same here. My mistake - I thought you simply wanted to see the questions. I'll investigate this, you should be able to see the feedback after the quiz deadline So the feedback settings for quizzes is already to provide all feedback once the quiz is submitted. see the screenshot. can someone confirm you can see the correct choices for quiz 1? ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-31%20at%201.42.30%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d726946f-c6e5-4a95-8658-fd44430e558b/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-31%20at%201.42.30%20PM.png)

Practice quize 8 Hi,  Can someone please help me with this practice quiz 8 question :( ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6df81136-9266-4de1-bb63-5bd5dc5c9b81/image.png)in a unigram model, you will draw one word at a time from the overall distribution until you have completed your "sentence". each draw from the unigram model will be completely independent.  when we have independent events and want to know the probability of all of those events occurring, you must multiply the probabilities of each individual event to get the answer  so, let's say you generate 3 words from a unigram language model, and get words `x`,`y`, and `z`. then, your sentence is essentially `"x y z"`. so, what is $$P("x y z"| \theta)$$? Well, since we draw each word independently, it is equivalent to the product of the individual probabilities: $$P("xyz"|\theta) = P("x" | \theta) * P("y" | \theta) * P("z" | \theta)$$   Thanks 🙏
Quiz 3 question Can anyone help explain this question? I am confused. ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-13%20at%208.57.12%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/5573f737-d5f2-4622-bdbc-6e47534190b9/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-13%20at%208.57.12%20PM.png)The condition suggests that A has higher number of relevant docs at any k. Recall at position k is calculated as #relevant doc retrieved at k/# total relevant docs, therefore A will have higher recall at any position.  Thank you! "Any K " is the trick here !For both precision and Recall "Relevant Retrieval" is still important. Recall the formula from the slide or book, P=a/a+b , R = a/a+c.  Since at no point in the entire K doc set , the Precision is better for System B, hence intuitively and also mathematically the recall for System B is lower than System A. This graph will further help to understand.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/05c2cdc6-d806-4332-9162-b5fe2fbdede4/image.png)
LiveDataLab not syncing with Git I can't even see my pushes to the git repo, and under LiveDataLab it just shows a blank space.  I read a couple of solutions related to this: 1. I registered LiveDataLab with my school email and that only 2. I deleted and re-linked my git account multiple times 3. There is only me as the author in the git repo, aside from the original author that I cloned from  but LiveDataLab still decides not to sync.....So the real problem seems that I cloned directly from the git repo provided, which caused git to think I'm not the only author(?) After redoing a new repo via **uploading** all 3 files, I was able to get the webhook attached and working.

If you are pressing the run button in vscode, it will use the interpreter shown in the bottom right. If that's the case, then click the interpreter in the bottom right and select the appropriate interpreter path.  If you activated the environment using a command in the terminal, then you can run the file directly in the terminal  ``` python search_eval.py config.toml ```
Metapy installation issue solved using conda I know many classmates have already said the metapy installation worked with conda, I just wated to list the steps here, if that helps anyone still stuck in that step.  ``` //know where python is installed **where python** C:\Users\SAHARX3\Anaconda3\python.exe C:\Users\SAHARX3\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe  //create a new environment under conda  **conda create --name cs410_env1** environment location: C:\Users\SAHARX3\Anaconda3\envs\cs410_env1  //activate the new environment **conda activate cs410_env1** (cs410_env1) C:\Users\SAHARX3> //conda deactivate will deactivate the environment and bring you out of it  //install python3.5 **conda install python=3.5**  //install metapy and pytoml **pip install **metapy** **pip install pytoml**  //testing **python** **import metapy** //if metapy is installed successfully, this should not give any error  **python example.py** ```Thank you very much for sharing the useful tips!
CS 410 DL Not Functional After downloading the extension, when I try to signup clicking the buttons in the UI provides no results. I can't sign up nor utilize the tool.

Lesson 3.2: precision vs recall Like discussed in the lecture, having only precision or recall be perfect (1.0) isn't very useful.  If we were to choose only one metric, would precision or recall be more important in application? Is one metric considered more applicable for most tasks, or is it pretty dependent on the task at hand? Or do we not worry about that since the F-score rewards similar values while penalizing extreme values?  Thanks!In most situations, we just use F-score to compare and rank methods. To analyze and improve performance of these methods in details, we need to analyze Precision, Recall, F-score all. I think three metrics are equally important. Thanks for your insight! Michael, it seems that the beta coefficient allows either precision or recall to be weighted more heavily when calculating F-measure, depending on the application.  In these three charts, the vertical (Z) axis is F-measure; recall and precision are the X and Y axes on the base. The first chart is F1. When beta is less than 1, precision gets more weight. When beta is greater than 1, recall gets more weight. I made these to help myself understand the formula. I hope you find them helpful as well.  ![F-meas_beta-1.0.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/0bd4f46a-4d1a-43e9-b72c-050996fca4b2/F-meas_beta-1.0.png) ![F-meas_beta-0.3.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/bde8275a-a8ef-46ed-a949-26686ec1274e/F-meas_beta-0.3.png) ![F-meas_beta-3.0.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/d1c05cfd-04b1-4542-99a6-572b4067158b/F-meas_beta-3.0.png)  Thank you for sharing the excellent analysis and beautiful plots! It shows nicely the tradeoff that we can make by adjusting the parameter in the F measure and helps interpret this tradeoff in applications. (Note that the F measure is not so interpretable as Precision or Recall alone. )  Thank you for posting this good question. As the responses from the students already said, the "right" measure to be used is generally task-dependent. For example, if a user cares a lot about Recall (e.g., doing a literature survey), then when it comes to the tradeoff between Precision and Recall, having higher recall (at the cost of lowering the precision) is desired, whereas if you just want to check out the major events that happened today in news article search, Recall would not be important. One thing often missing in research publications is that they would use just one parameter setting (F1 is very popular), but depending on the specific application, F1 may not be the best. Thus varying the parameter beta may be needed; at least, showing F measure values with multiple settings of beta would be more informative. That said, however, when we compare two retrieval algorithms/systems, we are mainly interested in their relative performance. For such a purpose, using just F1 is also acceptable since any inaccuracy of F1 in capturing real application utility would unlikely favor a particular algorithm or system involved in the comparison.  Thanks for the clarifications! This is helpful for understanding the topic as a whole!  This is an amazing break down! Thanks for your response! So this is how I understand it. Since the problem is essentially empirical and would definitely need user interaction on relevancy of the retrieved data it is totally on the system to give the weight to precision or recall.  This is explained in the practice quiz 6 of week 3 where you do not want to miss a tweet so you make sure that the recall for the function is high and you do not miss any relevant tweet about threat. On the opposite we would want the retrieval function to be more precise on occasions where we are retrieving documents on a news about election. The retrieval function needs to be more precise in terms of selecting the actual facts vs. any random article that has query terms like election etc.
questions about project Hi Professor and TAs,  I have two quick questions about the project: 1) Where should the team leader be designated? In the [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmeAR8uMgTGbVHFwzw4UAvkFpW6ldEWO4hZt-RApO9c/edit?usp=sharing)? 2) Where should the proposal be submitted next week? Through CMT or Coursera? - There is a portal available at Coursera (Week 9), but the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFvippp_jyiUUXpWsps4Geh5KsyZRkJq/edit) shows that we need to submit via CMT  Thanks!1. You can designate the team leader in your proposal submission pdf. 2. The proposal should be submitted through CMT. You do not need to submit anything on Coursera.  Thanks, Kevin!
MP1 cant install metapy I followed the steps on post #211 but I still get this error message in my conda env when I try to install metapy. Has anyone seen this before or have suggestions?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/89ccba94-c21a-4fda-a21e-9d9b217c7f67/image.png)Yes, I am getting a similar error and I believe it has to do with the python version which should be Python 3.5 or 2.7. Specific Python versions (e.g. Python 3.7 on mac) could  cause issues with metapy. I had similar errors. Here is what I did to fix this.  1) Install latest version of Anaconda ( Note that It will come with Python 3.9) 2) Create Anaconda Env with Python 3.5 and activate it.  3) Install cmake while you are in python 3.5 env. 4) Install metapy and pytoml  Yes. I removed my python 3.10 version and installed with python 2.7. Then I can install metapy successfully. https://www.machinelearningplus.com/deployment/conda-create-environment-and-everything-you-need-to-know-to-manage-conda-virtual-environment/  This link may be helpful to you. I used some of commands from it.
Practice Quiz 3 question 3 - average precision In lecture 3.3 (approx. the 11:50 mark), the formula for Average Precision includes the denominator 10. I'd originally assumed this was the number of potential steps AKA the number of total documents at which we could evaluate precision (which is 10).  Based on the practice quiz (question 3), however, it seems like the denominator should be the total number of relevant documents in the collection (which, in the lecture video, is also 10).  Could someone confirm whether the denominator for Average Precision is (a) the number of relevant documents in the collection, or (b) the number of steps at which precision is evaluated? Thank you!It is the total number of relevant documents in the collection. The formula is also given on page 177 of the textbook (section 9.3). average precision = $$\frac{1}{|Rel|}\sum_{i=1}^{n}p(i)$$. Putting the explanation given in the textbook here: "p(i) denotes the precision at rank i of the documents in L, and Rel is the set of all relevant documents in the collection. If Di is not relevant, we would ignore the contribution from this rank by setting p(i) = 0. If Di is relevant, to obtain p(i) we divide the number of relevant documents we’ve seen so far by the current position in the list (which is i)" Makes sense - thank you!
Conditional Entropy, Mutual Information, and Syntagmatic Relations Does a low conditional entropy and high mutual information between two words indicate that they are syntagmatically related?  What if, when one word is present, the other tends to be absent? Wouldn't there be a low conditional entropy/high mutual information in that case? However, those words should not be syntagmatically related, as they do not commonly appear together, right? If one word is present while the other is absent, they will have no mutual information,  or maybe we can say they are "negatively" syntagmatically related. This is a good question! Indeed, in such a case, you may also have a low conditional entropy and high mutual information, but the two words are unlikely syntagmatically related since they don't tend to co-occur. In reality, such a case is probably rare, but it would be highly interesting to see whether there are such words in natural language text. Maybe you could explore it a bit if you have time? Or perhaps propose a course project on exploring this?  Because of this concern, it's very common to use Pointwise Mutual Information where we only consider the case when their correlation is via co-occurrence, i.e., both are present. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information
Questions on deep understandings of NL The professor said that tasks like translation needs a deep understanding of natural language and I do agree because in real life translators need to be good at both the source and target language.  Then, I suddenly came up with a thought that what is the deep understanding of natural language? How can we define the task of deep understanding in terms of what computer can process?  Can a level deep understanding of a sentence be represented by some kind of a numerical value? How do we evaluate if a system have a deep understanding of a natural language?From my understanding, we usually evaluate our language model with a test dataset like other non-language ML models. One of the popular benchmarks is [GLUE (The General Language Understanding Evaluation)](https://gluebenchmark.com/).  >Can a level deep understanding of a sentence be represented by some kind of a numerical value?  E.g., you can see **numerical** scores for language models on [the GLUE leaderboard](https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard). For a task such as retrieval of documents based on keywords of a query, we could get the relevant documents by just looking for documents in which those keywords are present.  Such tasks can be completed using simple statistical approaches. However, if you want to translate one language to another, using simple statistical approaches might not work. The machine needs to parse the text in the original text, understand its structure and determine how to translate it to the target language (the syntactic structures and the grammar rules of the two languages can be very different). This problem cannot be solved well by just looking at the words or word counts in the text, but rather, a better understanding of natural language is required (if you remember, natural language can be very ambiguous to machines because we skip a lot of context information assuming that a human reading it would be able to understand).  This is explained in detail on page 44 (Chapter 3) of the textbook if you want to read further. I would suggest looking at the section and also taking a look at the example of Eliza (a dialogue system) where they try to bypass the issues of understanding natural language by using simple rules. Thank you for the reference. I will read that.  Thank you for letting me know the name of the benchmark! Now maybe I should dig into how they actually composed the tests.

I Think your GitHub token may expired. Try remove the link from lab and generate new token from GitHub and relink with the lab Like I said in the post I have already create a new token and new webhook. What do you mean by relink with the lab? Beside a new webhook, did you do anything else? you need to remove the linked account from livedatalab. And relink it with github using your new token. there is instruction in MP1. It has nothing to do with the webhook.  That works, thanks. 
Just use Google Colab for MPs! Hey everyone, I just wanted everyone to know that you can use Google Colab for working on the Machine Problems. I was able to use it without any issues for MP1. There are no installation issues with metapy and pytoml on Google Colab. And since UIUC gives us an G Suite account, you can use that for making the Colab notebooks, and it won't count against your personal Google Account's storage!  Google Colab will also run much faster than your laptop, especially assuming future MPs might be more computationally demanding. All for free!   As far as pushing it to Github is concerned, I just made sure it is working on Colab correctly, and then copied it onto my local computer and pushed the code from there. This is because Colab doesn't have a direct integration to push to Github.  I would appreciate it if you like this post if you found it helpful.
Values for final output coming around [-177000,-176000......] Hello, my autograder on live data is giving me an incorrect implementation error because my values are coming around -177000 for the final array that it returns. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here because I think I implemented all the functions correctly. Can someone help with this? Thank you!It would be helpful if you can offer the screenshot of your code. But one potential problem could be your calcuation. Check the part where you calculate the score. Check the probability matrix and see if they are sum to 1 I am facing the same problem, were you able to fix this? I can't figure it out still not sure whats wrong... :( Hi! have you figured out what you're missing? I have the same issue too. Any update? Having same issue...
Is the digital library down? Hi,  Im not sure if this is a problem effecting others as well, but I can't seem to connect to the digital library. I have previously and currently have half of my links submitted successfully, but upon checking today, I am stuck on a redirecting page.   Is the library down? (May be relevant: I am using the Illinois VPN and am connected to the internet without issue. I have not altered or changed anything (chrome extension, computer updates etc...) from my last visit to the digital library.)  Thanks!  ![Screenshot%20from%202022-09-09%2015-54-36.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/f215aff4-3ed7-4908-b297-73e3b9484082/Screenshot%20from%202022-09-09%2015-54-36.png)I'm having the same issue! I have the same issue right now! Same issue for me. I can submit to the DL but I cannot connect to `http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000/auth` I too am having the same issue Just curious, how can we be sure submissions are being retained if we can't access http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000/auth? We cannot. I hope my submissions today were recorded. The Chrome extension said they were so fingers crossed. Hi everyone, looks like the server was frozen for some reason. I've restarted it now and everything works on my end. Please let me know if it doesn't work for you! It appears to be back up. It looks like it is back up! Thank you! If you click on the link 'My Submissions' link at top right, it will show you the list of all your submissions that were recorded. Also when you are submitting your items, the extension/tools always confirms with a message 'your submission has been recorded and indexed'.
MP 2.3 LiveDataLab doesn't have Scipy Hello, my code crashes when i try to submit it on livedatalab since it doesn't have scipy library installed. I use this library when computing the Pvalue that I write in the significance.txtYou can just calculate that locally and push significance.txt to the repo If you are using python, you can use this for pvalue calculation https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html You only need the value, you don't need to use the scipy on livedatalab. I had the same problem because I also edited the code to have the libraries. I just commented out the code I added and turned in the values.

Document Length Normalization for JM smoothing Please let me confirm. JM smoothing does not incorporate document length normalization, while Dirichlet Prior Smoothing does. Is it correct?Yes. That is the same very reason that p(w|d) remains same even if the term count doubles in the document Week 4 Quiz 5. Thanks, Hitesh!
MP2.2 I searched for "videos on Gamma Code" on the DL site. I see that even text related to gamma code like papers and posts on Campuswire apart from Youtube popped up. Would these posts and other links be considered relevant or not relevant?As per the instructions, we just have to review the search results (irrespective if they are text, paper, video, campuswire post, blog, etc) and access their relevance and select at least 10 relevant documents (or up to the number of returned results).   It would be similar to what we do when we try to search for something on a search engine. We review the documents returned and determine the ones that can help with our query. For example: with query 'How to compute gamma code', I might be looking for any type of documents versus 'videos on Gamma Code' I might be just interested in only the video type of documents or might have video as a preference but still be okay if I find a blog that is relevant to the computation of the gamma code.   In my opinion it depends on what as a user you find relevant for your query.  
PLSA equation for the equation, why would the background treated differently from the each topic? also, why do we have to keep the term of (1-λb) in the equation for each topic? wouldn't the math be more straightforward with prob of each topic θ * P(w|θ) and treat background as a category of topics as well?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/cb155ae4-4b14-4608-9004-64b42cf869d4/image.png)> why do we have to keep the term of $$1 -\lambda_b$$ in the equation for each topic?  Because the background topic is treated separately, and since every word might be generated from either the background topic or one of our `k` topics, we need to first detect the probability that the background model didn't generate the word, and then multiply that by the probability that the specific topic generated the word. This is a result of the split between Background and other topics -- because of the "tiered" nature of this split. First, we determine if the word should be from background, then if not determine which topic it should be generated from.  >why would the background treated differently from the each topic?  As far as why we treat the background model differently, i believe this is likely so we can have a single parameter to set to determine the amount of words generated from the background topic. While it would be straightforward to treat the background topic as just another topic (and I also have been wondering the same thing as you -- it should "work" at least to a degree i think as you describe), one benefit of explicitly pulling it out is that now $$\lambda_b$$ can be a tuneable parameter, whereas the $$\vec\pi$$s are estimated via some process like Expectation Maximization. That way we can control to what degree common words are removed, etc.  It's possible there are other (or better) reasons to separate out the background like this. But I am not sure, and I may want to also try to think about it a bit more. For now I will mark your question as unresolved; I also find this very interesting! thanks for helping - but I'm actually questioning why a "tiered" approach was taken... but working on MP3, seems the idea to treat background  differently was involved later, which implies such approach may bring some advantages in computation... perhaps because the background distribution is "known" - just a guess i think that is related to my second paragraph and beyond. i believe that the reason for this is so we can have a tuneable parameter, $$\lambda_b$$ for us to control how aggressive we are in filtering out common words, instead of relying on an approach like EM to find it like with the $$\vec\pi$$ values.  in PLSA, the user sets $$\lambda_b$$ but does not set $$\vec\pi$$, which i think allows us some control. there may be other reasons here as well as you've mentioned (ie efficiency).  i've edited my original answer to make the part where i answer this in more detail more clearly delineated The primary reason I find is that we need be able to control how much the background model contributes to the output. But, if we treat it as just another topic, then that background model will have to be a special topic with its probability controllable. That way, the background model is still considered to be one among the topics, but a special one, thus the parameter.  That's something I think, but may be there's some analytical reason.

I believe it should be calculated following this equation.  confused about c(w,d)here. it should be be c(w,d1) or c(w,d3)?

Q6 in Practice Quiz 4 Hi,  Can someone help with the below query ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c58be7c6-7a3a-4508-bceb-ece41759a9d2/image.png) My understanding is that the likehood will become 0 (instead of minus infinity) if a term is in the query and not in the document [without using smoothing]. Any idea why is it minus infinity?I suppose log 0 is minus infinity or undefined Ah, yes. Thanks for responding.
Quiz 1 Question on "better way to measure similarity" For this problem, we are asked among two methods which is a better way to measure similarity within a VSM model. I believe this topic is not covered in the week 1 module but the week 2 (unconfirmed since I haven't watched it yet). This question should appear in Quiz 2 instead right? If this is the case, should the instructors post a note on watching the relavant sections of week 2 before attempting quiz 1?I believe I know the question you're referring to. I'm not sure how much we're allowed to discuss material from the graded quiz, but to my knowledge, I don't believe the information for that question was stated in the week 1 lectures (I just reviewed my week 1 notes and haven't started week 2 yet) - but it is briefly discussed near the very end of week 1's textbook readings (ch. 1-6). In Q9 of the practice quiz, the correct answer is that the L2 distance is affected by document length. Someone also posted this link to me as an explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19410270/vector-space-model-cosine-similarity-vs-euclidean-distance  This problem should be similar to the one on the practice quiz. even the question was shown in the practice question, there is no a clear answer whether the method affected by document length is superior than those not...  think about it twice - i take my word back LOL
deadline and tasks of Tech Review and Project Hi all,  Here I summarize the deadline (US Time) and tasks for Tech Review and Project.

Looks good, from what I can tell. Note that the reports per reviewer might be 2~3, rather than 1~2. But the groups that each reviewer will review will be held mostly consistent throughout each review point.  okay, updated!
Text Classification Evaluation For Single Document and For Classifier What do you calculate precision and recall for? Each document? Each category? Each classifier? Could you provide some examples? Thank you.  Also, on slides 5-6 of 11.3, what do the columns with "c"s on top mean? How do some documents have a "y" (system says yes) in multiple columns?i'll start with clarification of slides 5-6 of 11.3: the columns with the "c"s on top are "categories". the rows, "d" are documents. let's say you have 3 categories, `{"sports", "science", "art"}`. a single document may be about science and not art, or maybe it is about both science and sports. this is how we can get multiple columns, and each document has an evaluation for that category. there is a ground truth (the `+` and `-`) for that document for that category, and a system evaluation (`y` and `n`)  generally, there are a few different ways to calculate precision and recall, and you've mentioned a couple of them. these are the types of aggregations covered in Week 11:  - **Per-Document Evaluation**: How good are the decisions on document $$d_i$$ -- this can be done on each document, and is done per document. in the slides you reference this would be aggregating precision/recall over a single row (and getting a different measure for each row)  - **Per-Category Evaluation**: How good are the decisions on $$c_i$$, the individual category. here we go over columns instead of rows in *per-document evaluation* (getting a different value for each column)  - **Macro Average over all the Documents**: Once you have your *per-document evaluation*, you can then aggregate (ie via a simple arithmetic mean) over all of the documents to get overall precision, overall recall, overall f-score  - **Macro Average over all the Categories**: Once you have your *per-category evaluation*, you can then aggregate over all the categories to get overall precision, overall recall, overall f-score  - **Micro Averaging of Precision and Recall**: this is similar to classification accuracy, as this simply looks over every entry and calculated precision and recall for every document and every category at once  generally speaking, you would also want to compare different classifiers using these measures to see which ones have better per-document, per-category, or macro/micro averages of these metrics.  please let me know if i answered your question or if i can clarify better
livedatalab failure without log solved: my github token expired... I had to delete the linked account from the lab and relink with new generated token. ___ I tried to submit my code but livedatalab keeps failure and no log. does anyone know why?![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-22%20at%201.44.58%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/ef113078-1cd7-4ab2-a26f-af25a3d561ba/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-22%20at%201.44.58%20PM.png) ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-22%20at%201.45.11%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e3389c4a-2e8d-4144-8696-fb3ba8ff2467/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-22%20at%201.45.11%20PM.png) What do you see in LiveDataLab on the "submission history" screen? I have encountered similar issues like that before. Two steps I've tried and worked:  1. Try logging into the tool again via Coursera (Open Tool link) or 2. Re-do all of the GitHub cloning steps once again to reset the webhook just highlighted in orange like my previous other failures.  Are git add, commit, and push are working for you? If yes, then your repo will show something like "plsa.py updated a few  seconds ago" every time you push.  If git add, commit, and push __are__ working, then you should not need to repeat the git clone process. However, you should try to recreate the link between GitHub and LiveDataLab. You could start by redoing the webhook, as Gabe suggests. Please remember that the link in the instructions beginning "livelab" is NOT correct. Another possible cause is your GitHub personal access token has timed out. (The default token life is only 30 days.) I had such an experience. yes thank you so much I just found my token expired and relinked and it works!
LiveDataLab: ImportError: cannot import name suppress Hi,  I'm trying to submit my MP1 but I kept getting this error message. My code was successfully committed and pushed to my Github.

That could help. I am seeing deprecation warning all here. I installed Anaconda and used it for metapy. I'm actually running it on 3.5 thru conda...  The grading part is done in the cloud so i guess it has nothing to do with my local python version? it looks like your code is trying to import something called `suppress` from `contextlib`; not sure if the true stacktrace here is being obfuscated a bit, but i don't have that import (i only import `metapy`). is it possible to remove this import, or is that being imported by `metapy` as well? Thank you Ryan! You found the issue.  I did not even realize that on top of my code there are two extra lines - ``` from contextlib import suppress from curses import meta ```  I swear I never wrote these two lines and i have have no idea where they came from. Guess vscode added them for me when i did not notice? lol. But after deleted these two lines, the submission finally succeed... but with a 50% grade. Smh. Do you happen to know where i can find a more detailed feedback from the grader? Thanks. oh great! yea i know sometimes IDEs like to "help" you by including imports they think are relevant so that could be it  as far as additional feedback, i'm not sure how detailed it is for this assignment. my advice here would just be to double check and make sure you are doing each and every step listed in the readme, and that you are doing it in the right order, namely: 1. tokenize with ICUTokenizer (with argument `suppress_tags=True` 2. lowercases 3. removes words with less than 2 and more than 5 characters 4. performs stemming 5. produces trigrams for an input sentence  let me know if that doesn't help, i'll see if i can find anything additional about the livedatalab autograder output oh also check #268 i just found this campuswire answer that may be relevant since this post also mentioned a score of 0.5   Thank you so much Ryan! Yes i missed the lowercase. much appreciated. i wish the grader could tell us which test the code did not pass lol. no problem SiCheng! very happy to help
MP2.3 grader is missing Hi TAs and Professor,  Currently, when I submitted my file for grading, I was met with this error. ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e855ab88-9331-4cac-a567-b2c3e5ed1bc2/image.png)  Can someone check this? Thank you  DanhSorry about that, can you try now?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/671d25b8-529e-4bf1-8f84-be03b87cbca5/image.png) Still failed but different message now. It said InL2 is not implemented correctly but a line above it said that there is no log2 in 'module'. I was able to run everything locally so maybe upstream build is missing some dependencies like 'math'.

Looks like the grader is not happy with your InL2 function? I was able to get my submission to pass just now. Got it! log2 is not implemented on whatever version python the azure machine is using. So just need to change math.log2 -> to math.log(w/e, 2). Submission just got graded! Thanks everyone   Thanks Danh for sharing the change math.log2 -> to math.log(w/e, 2) . It helped in my implementation. 
Proposal Submission in Coursera When will Coursera reflect the submission via CMT? Also, only one group member is to submit at a time, correct?Yes, that seems to be the case based on this document -  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFvippp_jyiUUXpWsps4Geh5KsyZRkJq/edit . Team leader needs to submit the document. Once we click on Submit button, Coursera shows as the assignment is submitted. For the grades, looks like it will be updated by TAs after the peer and Staff review
submitting different articles from same link  can we submit different articles from the same link ?I'm having some difficulty understanding your question - do you mind sending the link here which has the articles that you'd like to add? To my understanding of your question: You can try to find out the source of each article. In this case, each source is a different link.  Or you can just highlight and submit each of these different articles (one by one) on the same page(link). In this case, all submissions will be under the same link. It seems one link (url) is considered one resource, and you need at least 15 of them. i see  thanks I think its better to use different links either mentioning different topics or same  topics.  The DL will record the qty of your submission.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/bc6f4ba0-6d67-4eb1-a599-daccbb70b4aa/image.png)  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/23c626f0-f7d1-45f9-993a-b8f8f7bcd67e/image.png) awesome  thanks  If your question is if we can use the same browser window to find different documents/ articles and then submit them using the extension, then the answer is yes.   Remember as long as you are on a webpage that is different than the one you had submitted previously then it should be okay.  In my understanding, there could be one exception to when you would want to submit the same URL more than once. It would make sense if that document talks about two or more important topics for example - Stemming and Lemmatization, then for better tagging you can use the same URL with two query points assuming that the document is relevant enough for the users to be able to retrieve it for both the searches.
Submitting Team Roster Does anyone know how to submit a team roster?  It is due by Sunday at midnight, correct?  Thanks!!For the October 17th deadline: please fill out [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmeAR8uMgTGbVHFwzw4UAvkFpW6ldEWO4hZt-RApO9c/edit?usp=sharing) according to [the instructions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmeAR8uMgTGbVHFwzw4UAvkFpW6ldEWO4hZt-RApO9c/edit?usp=sharing). You do not need to do anything on Coursera for this deadline.      Thank you! Both those links point to the same thing. Did you mean to post instructions?
how to find c(t, D)? In the section 'Writing lnL2', im confused how we find the values for c(t, D) and c(t, Q). I know all thre other values come from sd but it doesnt look like sd has those 2 values.  Am I missing something?You can review the list of available attributes in the `sd` object. There is a description of each parameter, which includes `c(t, D)` and  `c(t, Q)` https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html so would corpus_term_count be considered c(t, Q)? I think corpus_term_count would be something like c(t, C).  The total number of times the term occurs in the corpus, no? that makes sense, but then which one would be c(t, Q)? Something like query_term_weight/query_length? I found it where where Jose did.   Check out the link Jose posted: https://meta-toolkit.org/doxygen/structmeta_1_1index_1_1score__data.html  c(t,D) -> count of term in the document c(t,Q) -> count of term in the query  there are attributes with descriptions very close to that.
Is Coursera down? My Coursera seems bugged, all courses are unenrolled and nothing shows up. iPad version bugged too. Cannot view lecture materials nor do quizzes.same here. exam approaching soon...  I wonder if this is related to the MCS program application deadline (10/15) as for the next round of application the deadline will need to be updated... ^ ^ ^ Also experiencing issues on Coursera Experiencing same here same Me too... Exam is coming... Not a good time :( Same here. https://downdetector.com/status/coursera/ You can still get to the course if  you open a direct link...  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/home/week/1 coursera is back up.
Tips for MP1 setup Hi, It is my first time doing bare clone and mirror push with Github. I worked very hard to understand the instructions and finally did it correctly! Here are some tips that may help you: 1. all the commands are in your local terminal; 2. after you did mirror push you may need to enter your github username and password. Please use your access token (used to link your github to LiveDataLab) as your password (not your account password). see:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17659206/git-push-results-in-authentication-failed 3. Make sure when you link you github account on livedatalab the right information (**github username not your email address**) is used! The URL for the webhook is fixed now. The correct link should be shared by the instructor or TAs. Please see below my config: ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-22%20at%2011.05.01%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c6919a81-e4f0-4e74-b752-c0a9d65f779e/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-22%20at%2011.05.01%20PM.png) ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-22%20at%2011.04.38%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a77a5d8d-94a7-4476-a6fb-d5cbae229b6b/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-22%20at%2011.04.38%20PM.png) 4. if you use VS code, it is even easier to commit and push the changes onto github. Make sure you enabled git in your VS code settings.  If you find these tips are helpful, please give a "Like".

MP1 Webhook - bad link I am attempting to add the webhook to my MP1_private repo, but the supplied: http://livelab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger  is not valid/able to connect to host.  Do we have an updated url?  Will this url be working in time?    Thanks in advance!try **livedatalab** instead of livelab.  Just tried that, and am getting the same warning.  Are you getting a warning on your end?  Can you paste the url that is working for you?   check this post: https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/4 this is not the webhook Please try this one: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/course/join/WZS77P00E570J74 This is what I am seeing with the above and below url's:   ![1.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/14c9ed12-1b59-4c92-b279-caad2640d68c/1.png) is this one working: http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/webhook/trigger  haven't tried it yet.

Metapy Module Not Found Hello, I have looked all over the campuswire and tried many solutions (Windows Machine) yet I have not been able to solve the error I have been experiencing.  ``` $ py search_eval.py Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\DEV\MP2.2_private\search_eval.py", line 5, in <module>     import metapy ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'metapy' ```  I am in a conda environment (Python 3.5/2.7) after seeing other students' suggest it and metapy is installed in it.  ``` $ pip install metapy Requirement already satisfied: metapy in c:\users\kings\.conda\envs\py35_env\lib\site-packages (0.2.13) You are using pip version 10.0.1, however version 20.3.4 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command. ```  I don't know what to do, I have been at this all morning and have yet to get it working. Any idea as to what I could possibly do?I think you should run `pip install --upgrade pip` before running `pip install metapy pytoml`, as suggested in the setup tutorial from https://github.com/CS410Assignments/MP1 Are you running search_eval.py with the same version number of Python in which you installed metapy? Unfortunately, this did not fix the issue. I've tried it and even uninstalled them both to retry. @Harita Reddy I am using version 3.5 in Python, but I try running with ```py search_eval.py```, should I try ```python3 search_eval.py```? After doing so in the env, it says python is not found.  ```$ python3 serach_eval.py Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut from Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases. (py35_env) ```   Can you share the results of running the following commands within the conda environment?  ```bash where py where python3 where pip which py which python3 ``` ``` kings@DESKTOP-6P3S8M5 MINGW64 /c/DEV/MP2.2_private (main) $ where py C:\Windows\py.exe (py35_env)  kings@DESKTOP-6P3S8M5 MINGW64 /c/DEV/MP2.2_private (main) $ where python3 C:\Users\kings\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python3.exe (py35_env)  kings@DESKTOP-6P3S8M5 MINGW64 /c/DEV/MP2.2_private (main) $ where pip C:\Users\kings\.conda\envs\py35_env\Scripts\pip.exe C:\Users\kings\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Scripts\pip.exe C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\pip.exe (py35_env)  kings@DESKTOP-6P3S8M5 MINGW64 /c/DEV/MP2.2_private (main) $ which py /c/Windows/py (py35_env)  kings@DESKTOP-6P3S8M5 MINGW64 /c/DEV/MP2.2_private (main) $ which python3 /c/Users/kings/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3 (py35_env)  kings@DESKTOP-6P3S8M5 MINGW64 /c/DEV/MP2.2_private (main) $ ```  Here is the output of all the commands. It seems that python3 and py are recognized outside of the env. Can you share the results of `which python` as well. ``` kings@DESKTOP-6P3S8M5 MINGW64 /c/DEV/MP2.2_private (main) $ which python /c/Users/kings/.conda/envs/py35_env/python (py35_env)  ``` Here you go!  And here is the output when running with python (Unsure of what it means currently):  ``` $ python search_eval.py Usage: search_eval.py config.toml (py35_env)  ``` It looks like metapy was resolved, so you are on the right path. Even I was unable to get metapy to install correctly on my computer. To solve this issue, I am simply using Google Colab for MPs, because metapy works natively there. Refer to this post - https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/153
MP2.3 Repository Not Found I have been trying to clone my repository but I am getting the error: remote: Repository not found. fatal: repository 'https://github.com/kduddi2/MP2_private.git/' not found even though when I click the link I am able to see my repository which I populated with everything from the CS410Assignments repo. I have been having this issue for the last MP as well but I am not sure how to fix it. I have tried different git clone commands that I have found.  Would appreciate any ideas anyone has to go about this. Thanks!can you try cloning through the git url, in other words: `git clone git@github.com:kduddi2/MP2.3_private.git` ? also, i think the repo should be named `MP2.3_private` instead of `MP2_private` but that shouldn't make a difference for cloning I think your may make sure you logged in GitHub.  Check your github is correct. There are other ways to upload the code. You have an option on Github gui to import directly from the repo of interest. Or try to download the files to local machine and then you can upload the files directly to your git project. I was able to figure it out. The issue was that I had a different GitHub account and password stored on keychain access on my laptop which impacted my git config. The repo was able to be found after I deleted it from keychain access.Thanks!
Things Due Now Other than registering for a Microsoft CMT account and signing up on the Project Sign-Up sheet, do we need to make a post on CMT? Or is that it?If it helps, similar query is answered at #998 & #892 Hmmm it seems like the forking stuff isn't until Oct 23? The next thing would be to submit the proposal before 23rd
Digital library submissions tracking Is there a way to keep track of how many submissions I've made or if I could view all submissions by user?You can track the number of submissions that you've made by visiting the website and clicking "My Submissions" after logging in. However, there is no way to see the number of submissions made by other users Hi Kevin - I have submitted more than 10 entries, but "My Submissions" only shows 10. Has anyone else had the same issue? The new ones (>10) that I submit did not show up. Yes, it looks like this is happening to me, too. I'll take a look into fixing this today. I've set the limit to 50 for now, so you should be able to see your submissions! Confirm that it's working now! Thanks a lot.  Perhaps it will be useful for someone else too, the website mentioned by Kevin is http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000/.
MP3 Shows as Green in Datalab but no Score Hello, I submitted a complete implementation of mp3. I tested in LiveDataLab and the results are green, but I am unsure if this means I passed the tests for it. Does this mean I passed or that the implementation was able to run for the tests?Green just means the code executed successfully, not that your implementation necessarily passed the scoring tests. Check the "leaderboard" link on LiveDataLab for results. The Leaderboard has been blank since my submission. Does this mean I should repull the entire project again? Haven't finished MP3 myself yet so I'm not sure, but the leaderboard has shown results (0/1) in the past. If you clicked through Coursera at least once before your most recent commit, do you see a grade populated in the Coursera gradebook? No the grade hasn’t been populated in coursera either. I am also experiencing the same thing.. I changed the status to ‘unsolved’ for TA’s attention.  I am seeing your grade on the leaderboard It seems like your tests did pass, not sure why your grade is not showing up on the leaderboard. I've updated your grade on Coursera.  Thank you! @Priyanka This is the leaderboard that I can see and it says 0. Are you saying I didn't pass this assignment yet?  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-12%20at%204.47.16%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6b081c9e-e4fd-4f81-ab62-f2b1c905ae34/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-12%20at%204.47.16%20PM.png) Then, this is very confusing as I am seeing 'success' here. Coursera is still at 0% as well.  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-10-12%20at%204.47.03%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8905e3d9-bf6e-4c33-b952-8cc2c47e22ef/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-12%20at%204.47.03%20PM.png) Hm, is your code running locally? Have you removed the print statements from the expectation and maximization step functions i.e.:  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/2973ce2e-d4c9-451f-82d0-66fb92ef2bf8/image.png) Yes I did removed those as it caused issues/delays when I tried to see the logs. My code worked locally..  Should I keep the print statements?  +1 Do we have to remove all the print statements ??
Orientation & Quiz 1 Due date Hi, I just discovered that the quiz due date for the orientation quiz and quiz 1 are both August 22, 2:59 AM EDT for me. Technically, I wasn't even able to see the class on Coursera until August 22, let along finish both quizzes in 3 hours after 12:00 AM. I just want to check if I already got a zero for both quizzes since the quizzes weigh 25% of the final grade? Thank you very much.The due dates are incorrect, it should the coming Sunday. We are working on fixing this. #38 This is now fixed.
What is k_3 in the BM25 model Hello, I was working on MP2.3 and had this question: what is k_3 in the BM25 model? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a10324e9-4f23-474a-a4bb-a82043ff7296/image.png)  The equation in the textbook does not have k_3 ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/55e15595-06fd-4dcf-aba8-fad3cbc84837/image.png) Thanks,https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/vip/teach/IRcourse/1_retrieval_models/slides/m03.s03%20-%20TF-IDF%20and%20Okapi%20BM25.pdf  The 7th slide has an BM25 formulation with k1 and k2.  I don't understand it, but seems to be a tf adjustment? I had the same question. From what I could find out, both k1 and k3 are for adjusting the effect of term frequency. k1 pertains to Document term frequency. k3 pertains to Query term frequency. An equation using both k1 and k3 can be found at on the fourth page of this paper: http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/pubs/schuthecir14.pdf. Here is that equation:.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/dfdb6e13-f3f1-4805-99f0-0a9a13d962a0/image.png) There may be other BM25 equations; I didn't look that far. From what I've found from [this resource](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/pubs/schuthecir14.pdf), BM25 can be expressed with a $$k_3$$ term as shown below. Here, the $$k_3$$ term is a parameter in an expression for the query term frequency weighting. It can be seen that this expression is independent of the document being scored, so it's the same value for each respective query term for all scored documents.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c7c3681b-86aa-4068-940c-52b7cd8fe46a/image.png)
Number of Submissions MP2 When I look at "My Submissions" on the CS410 Digital Library page, it seems like it only prints out 10, no matter how many I submit.  Am I doing something wrong?  Thanks!!Looks like TA Kevin is looking into it https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/344 Hey Frank,  No, you're not doing anything wrong. The limit was previously set to 10. I've changed it to 50, which should be sufficient for the assignment. 
Week 2 ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/c64ca861-ec13-4535-8263-baef2ccd49d4/image.png)  Can someone decompose the steps here? How are we getting 101 for 3 in Y-codeAs mentioned in the slide,  Gamma code stores integer in two parts **First part:** 1 + floor(log x) in unary **Second part:** x – 2 power floor(log x) in binary using floor(log x) bits Here log is to **base 2** for both the parts.  If X= 3  **First part:**  1+ floor (log 3) = 1+ floor(1.5849) = 1+1 = 2 , Unary of 2 = 10 **Second part:** 3 - 2 power floor( log 3) = 3 - 2 power 1 = 3 - 2 = 1  So, the gamma representation 	= first part which is 10 & second part which is 1 (to be represented in 1 bit) 								**= 101** Hi,  I had a similar question. I think the answer below helps with the decomposition of what we learnt in the lecture video. It does get a bit tricky when we have a number like 5 or 6 which share the same floor[log] value of 2.  For example: If X = 5,  First Part: Unary of (1 + floor[log 5]) = Unary of (1 + 2) = 110 Second Part: Binary of (5 - 2 ^ floor[log 5]) = Binary of (5 - 4) = 01  I was a bit confused as to why we chose the two bits here and how would we represent when X = 6 since the first part will remain the same while the second part be binary of 6 which in two bits becomes 10 but again why 2 bits?   Another way to calculate the gamma code,  **Approach:**  If X = 5,  **Step 1:** Calculate the binary of 5 = 101 **Step 2:** Remove the first digit from the number: new number - 01 (after removing the first digit). **Step 3**: Prefix the number with unary of 5 i.e. 110. Note: Another way to think about this is to take **01** and add number of 1's based on the length (i.e. since length of 01 is 2, we add 11) followed by a 0.   Gamma Code = 11001  The one thing that messed me up was how many digits to use for the binary (rightmost) part.  Do you use 01 or 001 or 1?  It seems like the answer is that you use floor(log x) bits.  Is this correct?  Thx!! Yes, its floor (log x) bits where log is to the base2 
Question about Practice Quiz 4 - Question 7 Hi,   I have some confusion regarding the answers of following question:  **Which of the following is NOT correct about the unigram model?** 1. The probability of generating the word A OR B is the sum of the probability of generating A and the probability of generating B. 2. The probability of generating the word sequence "A" "B" "C" is the same as generating "C" "B" "A." 3. The probability of generating the words A AND B is the product of the probability of generating A and the probability of generating B.  I don't understand why option 1 is NOT correct, personally, I feel since the description in Option 1 is suggesting that only one of the words "A" and "B" can be shown at a time, so they should be considered as mutually exclusive, thus: $$p(A\;or\;B) = p(A) + p(B)$$  Could someone please point out where I was wrong?   Thanks I do agree that the question is not clear in this case and might cause confusion. Since this is a practice quiz, it should be okay but we will make changes for the future. This question is not clear. I have already asked TAs and could not get a satisfactory reply. In my opinion, the original meaning of option 1 is "the 'words' A OR B", and it should be (1 - p(A) - p(B)) ^ 2 in this case. We will get this question reviewed. I agree that the question is unclear. I see, thank you so much! May I ask what is "the 'words' A OR B"? I am still confused about why it is 1 - p(A)*p(B) in this case for "the 'words' A OR B". I am still thinking it is p(A)+p(B). Could you provide more details? Thank you very much. Sorry, I was wrong about the probability in the previous answer. In my understanding, "the 'words' A OR B" means a language model generates two words. Then the probability of one of these two words is A or B is (1 - p(A) - p(B)) ^ 2. If the language model just generates one word, the probability is p(A)+p(B). In short, the question is not clear about the number of words the language model generates. I am still confused. Lol. I agree with you "If the language model just generates one word, the probability is p(A)+p(B)". But maybe this question is not so important. Thank you very much for your further explanation! One explanation I have is word A may be the same as word B, then the probability is P(A).
MP2.1 Content Hi there, I wonder whether the lessons of Week 2 are sufficient for us to do the MP2.1 or not. Thank you.The overview document & digital library instructions shared seem to be sufficient for completing MP2.1.  Yes, MP2.1 does not depend on the topics covered in Week 2.  I cannot access Overview document. It says I dont have access to google doc. can any one provide overview document and DL instructions The content of Week2 is sufficient to finish the MP2.1. You can get it done quickly as you follow the instruction.
get 0.5 points for MP1 Hi everyone, I believe I followed the instruction steps but only got 0.5 points, does anyone know the problem, I do not know how to see the issue from the log on livedatalabYou might have missed stemming process.  There is a README file in repository. If you hadn't read it carefully, I recommend you to read it and follow every process.  #128 will also help you if you use jupyter notebook. Thanks! I did forget to add the step for stemming. issue fixed
Stopwords - MP2.4 I am just wondering if we have to apply the stopwords filter somewhere in the assignment and then the ranking function ? The assignment mentions only to change ranker function.You don't have to do that. You just need to edit the ```load_ranker``` function by adjusting its parameters, using another ranking function, or implementing your own ranking function that passes the baseline to get full credit. thank you !!

Download individual slides for the course  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/918a417c-e070-43f2-9d8e-3819581679d7/image.png)  2. Download all the slides for the course using coursera-dl https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl 
Slides for 6.6, 6.8,  6.9 How can I download the slides for lectures 6.6, 6.8, and 6.9 ?If you download the slides from lesson 6.5, it looks like it includes 6.6 as well in the pdf. Further, this appears to repeat for downloading 6.7 (which includes the slides for 6.8 and 6.9.)  It requires that you only download part 1 pdf slides to receive part 2 and part 3 slides where available.  Just as a note, the pdf download for 6.7 says on the first slides "part 1 and 2 (6.8)", but includes part 3's slides (6.9) at the very end as well. Thanks, I have not checked the pdf yet.
Practice Quiz 11 - Q2 Confusion or Error Question 2 asks us to select the answer that is not true. I've calculated them multiple times now, and I must be missing something, because I've calculated them all to be true. Where have I gone wrong?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8549a0a3-fe81-4136-ac5d-e37e4649c5c7/image.png)For precision, we want to calculate the rate of true postives y(+) over true posittives and false positives (y+ and y-).  For p(c3) we only have two y(+) and no y(-) which would result in a precision of 2/(2 + 0) or 1. The result with precision(c3) = 2/3 would be incorrect. First note that: - y(+) is a true positives (TP) - y(-) is a false positive (FP) - n(-) is a true negative (TN) - n(+) is false negative (FN)  $$Precision = \frac{\#TP}{\#TP + \#FP}$$ $$Recall= \frac{\#TP}{\#TP + \#FN}$$ $$F_1= \frac{2\cdot Precision\cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall}$$  P(c3) is the precision of the third classifier, so we only have to look at the values in the third column. $$P(c3) = \frac{2}{2+0}=1$$ R(c3) is the recall of the third classifier, so again we only have to look at the values in the third column. $$R(c3) = \frac{2}{2+1}=2/3$$    For the rest:  $$P(c1) = \frac{3}{3+0}=1$$  $$R(c1) = \frac{3}{3+0}=1$$  $$P(c2) = \frac{2}{2+1}=2/3$$  $$R(c2) = \frac{2}{2+0}=1$$  $$F_1(c2) = \frac{2\cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot 1}{\frac{2}{3} + 1}=4/5$$  $$F_1(c3) = \frac{2\cdot 1 \cdot \frac{2}{3}}{1 + \frac{2}{3}}=4/5$$ Ah, that's why. I was mentally exchanging the meaning of the y(-) and n(+) symbols. Thanks!
Doubt regarding Quiz 1 Hello,  I had a doubt regarding the Week 1 Quiz where the question was -   In VSM model, which of the following similarity/distance measures would be affected by document length?  1. L2 distance 2. Cosine similarity Hi,  I believe both cosine similarity and Euclidean distance are used to measure the proximity between vectors in a vector space. Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between the document irrespective of their size. I would recommend you look at how the two metrics are calculated to get a better understanding of them.  Okay, thanks a lot! In addition to Chandan's answer, #43 may be helpful. Think about how the value of Cosine and L2 distance changes as the vectors get closer or farther apart. Are those equally good measures of “similarity”? Specifically, what is the Cosine of a vector with itself (perfectly self-similar)? What about the L2 distance of a vector with itself? How about both measures with orthogonal vectors? Do the ranges match?
Not able to open LiveDataLab link I keep seeing this error when I try to open the livedatalab site using this link : http://livedatalab.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com/ As a result I am completely blocked. Please let me know if you have ideas. Thank you ![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-30%20at%208.46.51%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/598ab1a9-f677-4f58-a29c-a5b56a7421c2/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-30%20at%208.46.51%20AM.png)I see the same error. Was able to access it an hour ago (though all the projects were missing then). Probably TA's can help us know if some maintenance/change activity is in progress. Yeah, the site looks down right now - tried multiple browsers and command line apps but getting a server error each time.   Looks like it's hosted on Azure, though, which is having some major issues right now with DNS and container apps - could be related. https://status.azure.com/en-us/status ok at least we know its not a personal issue with laptop now.  Hi all, please refer to https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/21. We will update once we resolve issues. oh ok, but this issue is not with just submission. The link itself does not open. Ok np will keep monitoring, hopefully it gets fixed soon :) Thanks The website is opening fine for me but it is really slow as compared to before. Maybe there is some maintenance going on
Submission Success? I got result as below in livedatalab. But cannot see score in leaderboard (blank). Is it ok or I missed a step?

similar to this post: https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/1197   This looks like you passed. May be TAs can confirm Thanks Thanks I thought as long as you see a Score 1 on the leaderboard  you should be fine (TAs please confirm). Try adding another commit and push I have tried resubmitting, but still there is no score on the leaderboard. Hmm interesting. Maybe try reaching out to a TA. I saw a Score of 1 on the leaderboard after a couple of minutes of submitting 
3 Credit Tech Review Hello! For 3 credit students, do we need to submit that we won't be doing the Tech Review? Or do we simply not submit anything, and our status as a 3-credit student will be handled? Thanks!  I don't think you need to submit anything. Tech Review is only for students who took this course as 4 credits.
Cant see other's submission Hello i can only see my own submission in CMT https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CS410Expo2022I am not sure if we will be able to see submissions/Github links posted by others. Probably it is not the time for us to review?
1+log(x) can someone please help how come 1+log(5) is 3?  It is from lecture 2.5 I calculated 1+(log5) the value is  1.69, but in the lecture, it says the value of this is 3. I am confused! please help. Hello Nusrat! Try using log base 2 and applying the floor function, which rounds down to the next whole number.  log base 2 of 5 = 2.322.  floor of log base 2 of 5 = 2 thanks If it helps, can refer to post https://campuswire.com/c/G984118D3/feed/291 As David answered, I realized that it's log base 2.
1. Form a team (5%,  due beginning of Week 9, Oct 17, 2022) ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/948fdd88-5ea7-4059-8daf-36dc70fbd1c7/image.png)  Where is the form for us to submit? Namely, "1) this form," mentioned above.  Is it just this Google Sheet? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZmeAR8uMgTGbVHFwzw4UAvkFpW6ldEWO4hZt-RApO9c/edit#gid=0Correct, you only need to fill out the Google sheet according to the instructions for the October 17th team formation deadline.  Do we need to have project topic figured out by October 17th? Or can that be filled out by the proposal deadline? No, a tentative topic/idea is enough and you can change it later. It is required to be done by the proposal deadline. 
Metapy not recognized by PyCharm Anyone using Pycharm ? It's not able to identify "metapy" package even with conda virtual environment (Python 3.7).  Note that I'm able to use metapy from CLI.  Error : "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'metapy'"You might need to have a python3.5 conda virtual env for it. Maybe try Python 3.5 instead? I was able to run everything in PyCharm with 3.5  Also refer to the MP1 Setup section > Please note that students have had issues using metapy with specific Python versions in the past (e.g. Python 3.7 on mac). To avoid issues, please use Python 2.7 or 3.5. Your code will be tested using Python 3.5 Maybe try sublime or vscode instead? I can use metapy with sublime.  It looks PyCharm stopped support for python 3.5 Not sure if it's a good way, I installed python 3.5 through anaconda, I just use Pycharm for editing, but I run the code in the command line.
MP2.2 how many submission? Hi,  Just a quick reminder that the overview document hasn't been updated yet with MP2.2 and MP2.3 descriptions and requirements.  Is this intended?  ThanksPlease see [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/gradedLti/KGkqH/mp2-2) for the description and requirements for MP2.2.  I've also updated the overview document with the description and requirements.  For full credit, you must submit at least 5 queries, each with at least 10 relevance judgments  Kevin, Just a couple questions about the process for MP 2.2 and beyond: -  How are our judgments tabulated when there are multiple references to the same link, each with its own "relevant/not relevant" radio buttons? For example, if link A appears once and link B appears 8 times in the document set, and I mark all as relevant, will B be more heavily weighted in subsequent searches? - What happens (for subsequent searches) if I mark 4 instances of link B as relevant (e.g., based on their descriptions) and the other 4 as not relevant (e.g., because they have no descriptions)? - How would you like us to think about cases where a seemingly relevant document that is not accessible (e.g., requires a paid subscription to some service) and relevance is questionable based only on the publicly available info, such as the abstract? - How would you like us to handle links that do not work? I tripped over two examples: One led to a 404 error; the other was 'blocked' although its long URL ended with the actual document (http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4001/redirect?hash=9_none_cf6c6bbe-e5bc-4112-b495-3405f7dd5380&redirect_url=chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1708/1708.05148.pdf)    Thanks for the great questions!  1. Search is happening over the highlighted text + explanation, so each submission is treated as its own "result". Moreover, for the purposes of this assignment (and MP2.4), there isn't any "weight calculation". Rather, MP2.4 will be tuning weights of BM25 to maximize the retrieval performance. Outside of the assignment, I haven't thought much about how to weight judged results, but I think favoring B makes some sense, as it a more "popular" link.  2. Then in the assignment, the score will increase for retrieving the four instances marked relevant. Outside of the assignment, I'm not sure. 3. It might depend on the context. For example, if the result points to Netflix with the description of "movie and tv show streaming service", then I'd say it is relevant (even if I don't have a subscription). And generally, if it should be accessible by members of the CS410 class (e.g., though the library, VPN, or proxy), then it should not be marked as not relevant due to access. But if it is completely inaccessible, then it should probably be marked as not relevant.  4. Links that do not work should be marked as not relevant. In the future, I need to add a "Dead Link" feedback mechanism.   
Exam 1 open book or open note? Hi there, I wonder whether Exam 1 is open book or open note or not. It is very hard to remember all of the formulas and implications or something related.   Also, how should we prepare for Exam 1? Is there any practice exam or something similar?- The exam will be closed notes (i.e., no external material allowed). - You may use two sheets of scratch paper during the exam. - No calculators are allowed.  - No bathroom breaks are allowed.  https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/supplement/Q468O/exam-policies-and-technical-support  The "Lesson 6.10: Summary for Exam 1" lecture video is a summary.  Also, some general info from the course introduction video (from the transcript): > And another thing to mention is also to allocate a sufficient time for the preparation of two proctored exams because they will be given only once. That means, you only have one chance to take each exam, so you want to really prepare well for them. However, those exams are mostly to confirm that you have indeed mastered the materials. So, they will have similar questions to the quiz questions that you have already seen. And in fact, some questions may be exactly the same as the questions in the quizzes. And we do that because this would allow you to have some sense about what the questions might look like in the exams. So, they should not be much surprise if you have actually worked on all the questions in those quizzes and have made sure that you have understood the answers to those questions.
MP2.4 Faculty Score Hello, It seems like some students have very low faculty score even after the update. Suddenly drop down to 400 times lower. Do you know why this happens? ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-24%20at%204.01.36%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/cf84b050-8803-469d-b824-1b7ef19e54e0/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-24%20at%204.01.36%20PM.png)  I spent hours in tuning my parameters and still gets lower than 0.001 in faculty score. Please advise, thank you.I was trying to figure out what that was, since I also got that problem. Try deleting anything extra that was generated and wasn't in the original repo, that fixed it for me.  Thank you! It seems like the idx folder needs to be deleted. This was generated by the old dataset. I also had the same issue - couldn't understand why I can't get my scores up until I saw this post - deleted the idx folder and now it started working. Thank you guys! I had the same issue. I made a fresh clone of the assignment repo and it was resolved (originally cloned the repo on Thursday 9/22). Thanks everyone for this! I was having the same issue and it solved it for me
Lesson 3.2 Question about Document Collection Numbering Hello, I have a question about a slide in Week 3.  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/731063dc-864a-48c4-8ebb-e52bf8d8ee29/image.png)  In the slide above, shouldn't be the number in 'Document Collection' D10 instead of D48, if total number of documents are 10?  Thank you!The total number of relevant docs are 10, but the total number of docs in the whole document collection could be much more. I got it! Thank you! Conceptually, the number of relevant documents and total number of documents are two different things. The former relates to the number of document that are relevant for a query where as the total number of document are documents we have in our collection. We run our query in this collection to get the results.  I would recommend you revise the example provided in Lesson 3.3 at 10:59 into the video. It gives a nice intuition to who we can retrieve the non relevant document from the document collection and can go outside the number of results retrieved.   
Calculating Log Likelihood I don't understand what I'm doing wrong when calculating likelihood, I am getting the log of the self.document_topic_prob dot the   self.topic_word_prob then multiplying that with tem_doc_matrix and getting the sum ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/dd0713a8-da1e-4050-95c9-8f41d187e08c/image.png) but with that code I only get two iterations. Any pointers on what I'm doing wrong?What does your exit condition in the `plsa` function look like? You should be checking whether the delta (absolute value in the change in log-likelihood) is less than the threshold value, which is very small by default (like 0.0001). See question 4 on post #988. Make sure the formula you’re using matches the one there
Can I make my repo of tech review private? It seems like after forking, the repo is public by default. I wonder if I can make it private and still make it work with livedatalab. I am using my private Github account and I don't want the course-related content to be public on my profile. I'm not sure if this is possible. If you try making it private and still are able to receive a 1 on the leaderboard, then you should be good.  Thank you for your reply and I will try.   I don't mind the course shares our materials on the platform of the course but I feel uncomfortable that I have to make it public on my own "platform" without either being notified before setting up the livedatalab or having an alternative to finish the task. I hope you will understand.
MP3 convergence condition Is the MP considered a success if the program converges at (-inf) or have I made some error?You should see a score 1 on leaderboard if it is success.  It does show a 1 on the leaderboard, but when I check the log files I get a warning " RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in log", then it runs for 1 more iteration after that and displays SUCCESS You are probably dividing by zero somewhere in your code (maybe when you are calculating the log likelihood). I think they only check for e and m steps. On my first attempt I forgot to update current_likelihood value and still passed, but it ran 4k iterations. I fixed it and pushed and the number of iterations decreased significantly (~20). How many iterations does it take until the likelihood value converges?  For my code, I didn't notice the epsilon value, so I went with the np.isclose() method where I compared current likelihood value with previous likelihood value. With that I got around 520-570 iterations before it stopped with a SUCCESS.  Once I changed my code to include comparison with epsilon, Every single time my program stooped after 4k iterations with SUCCESS but when I checked my iterations, i encountered the same error around the same 520-570 iterations range.  My best guess is the way you are calculating the log likelihood might be off. See question 4 on post #988. Try the formula there. Your likelihood values should converge at an earlier iteration Just to confirm the formula for one document, log∑j∈topicsP(topic=j∣doc=d)∗P(word=w∣topic=j)) is essentially summation of each topic_prob multipled by the word_topic_prob of each word in that doc.  So for each topic we would multiply all word probs for a topic for a document and then multiply it by the topic prob of that topic for a document. Then we sum the results, and take its log.   Follow the formula on #988. You only apply the log on the result of the inner summation. Not the whole thing
Lesson 5.8: HITS Algorithm slide We see the following slide on [this Coursera lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/lecture/d6INf/lesson-5-8-link-analysis-part-3-optional).  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/929588c0-8973-4de8-84e5-839a21c2aa78/image.png)  Is a link from d1 to d4 missing in the graph above?Yes! Thanks for catching the error on this slide; I will need to correct it.  We need to either modify the graph to add a link from d1 to d4 or remove the "1" corresponding to this link in the matrix.

Do we need to commit example.py? yes! there is a place inside example.py where you should "place your code here"  I also see from the output that you're using python 2.7 and not python 3, things should theoretically still work with python 2.7 but I'd keep an eye on that.  Thanks , i am missing code .Does this code available for copy & paste or we have  to write it . Yes, you will need to write the code for the function tokens_lowercase thanks all for helping .

why we use ttest_rel and not ttest_ind For the MP2.3 git repo, the link for the python t-test is pointing to the function of ttest_rel.  I'm wondering why we are not using ttest_ind?  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/70f12879-0af4-4486-96f7-bcbd56ade0c7/image.png)We use ttest_rel() instead of ttest_ind(), as we wish to perform a paired t test.  According to Wikipedia, a paired t-test "is used when the samples are dependent; that is, when there is only one sample that has been tested twice (repeated measures) or when there are two samples that have been matched or "paired". "  We are comparing the performance of two ranking functions on the same data, where the ith entry in one list equals the AP from evaluating the results of a query using BM25, and the ith entry in the other list equals the AP from evaluating the results of the same query using InL2. The entries of these lists are therefore paired.  We would use an independent sample of scores, if each sample of values was drawn from some distribution separately, and there was no correspondence between the ith value in the first list and the ith value in the second list. 
Unable to get webhook submission on to LiveDataLab Hi,   I have added webhook successfully and committed to my repo.   I committed changes AFTER adding the webhook in.   However I do not see any web hook activity or submission history under my LiveDataLab page.   Could someone please help?  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-29%20at%209.33.43%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8f3075a4-7214-4a72-bec0-9393c58dcdbd/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-29%20at%209.33.43%20PM.png)   1. Can you try triggering the webhook manually and seeing the result? 2. What events is your webhook triggering off of? Should be `push` events if i recall correctly your webhook seems to connect.

I have deleted and re-linked my Github account multiple times (lowercase github.com, my username)   but it is not showing up (I added screenshot below to follow up).  Thank you so much! Are there any logs displayed for a submission?  Have you checked if the personal access token you used to link your github account has expired? From github, you can go to settings then developer settings at the bottom left and then click personal access token to check. Hi yes I have done this multiple times. The PAT is not expired. I am still unable to get submission through. Please help. I can share my repo if needed

Digital Library Submission Counter Hi, not sure if the tooling already has this functionality, but I think it'd be awesome if there was a count displayed to the user to view how many submissions they have done on the Digital Library.   This doesn't seem like a high priority, but would generally be helpful for user tracking as the number of submissions gets higher and higher.

git push --mirror error hi, I git cloned and then git push --mirror. But I have one error:   remote: Repository not found. fatal: repository 'https://github.com/myaccount/MP1_private.git/' not found where"myaccount" is my github account.  Can anyone help me out?  Thanks.You can directly upload the files to git and commit.  I was encountering the same issue and I resolved it by adding my github id in front of github.com. So try git push --mirror https://myaccount@github.com/myaccount/MP1_private.git instead. You may want to consider creating an access token for github as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github). If that's not enough info, you can google tutorials for your specific OS.  Then your command would look like: ``` push --mirror git@github.com:your_user_name/MP1_private.git # note the ':' after github.com ```  For a drag-and-drop implementation to this issue you could use [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) .   It works, thanks! This should be the best way to access each github project.
mp 2.1 grade How do we know what our grades are for mp 2.1? I am following the instructions to submit websites to the Digital library, but don't know how to confirm this/ view a grade for it. "And grading for the assignment will be updated on Coursera once the assignment is due."  This is what the overview document mentions. I think we may know our grades on Coursera next week. But what if we did something wrong? Can we rectify it?  I don't think so. We indeed need to be careful. However, this mp just requires us to record 15 relevant web links with detailed instructions, so maybe it is not so bad. I will mark this question unresolved, so we can wait for an answer from TAs. As mentioned, the grades will be uploaded early next week. As long as you have at least 15 submissions (can check "My Submissions" at http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000), you should receive full credit.   Edit: it was a "/" instead of a "." I've changed it to be correct. This link did not work, I am getting a ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED issue.  I am using the vpn, not sure what is wrong.   Sorry, not sure why that link didn't work. Try this:  http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000/ Yes the second link works, thanks!  Please review the instructions provided for MP2.1.  ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-11%20at%204.23.39%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/97d2e370-accb-42a4-a704-37d8e6922984/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-11%20at%204.23.39%20PM.png)  From a student perspective, we are good, as long as we  have submitted 15 relevant documents using the extension. We have the ability to verify the submissions using the link: [My Submissions](http://timan.cs.illinois.edu:4000).   
How to get the green check mark for Week 3? I'm assuming we will not be able to get a full completion status until **after** the due date?   During Week 3 for MP 2.1 it says "*grading for the assignment will be updated on Coursera once the assignment is due.*" I've completed MP 2.1 but just wanted to make sure I get a completion status. Can anyone confirm whether there are additional steps to get the green check mark in Coursera? TYIA! ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e1d0fb4a-3fc9-4c35-a234-4a8bc7b74f6d/image.png)For both MP2.1 and MP2.2, I will periodically batch upload grades to Coursera. As long as you can view 15+ submissions on the DL website and the account uses your NetID and/or university email, you should be good. I will make an announcement when I upload the grades so that you can double-check that you received credit.  I have updated DL with 15 relevant docs. However, I have not received my grade on coursera yet. Just wanted to check if I missed anything in my submission. Thanks  Hey Guru, if this is not yet answered for you: Kevin answered this in the previous comment, that he will make an announcement when he uploads the grades. Got it ! I thought  that the grades will be uploaded prior to the due date. Thanks
How to prepare for Exam1 Lesson 6.10 with the title "summary for exam 1" doesn't mention exam 1 explicitly.  Are only the contents from lessons 1-6 covered for Exam 1?  When to register for exam 1?  Thank!You can schedule the exam now.  I already have. There are 3 options to select . Which one to select for the exam.![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-27%20at%2010.12.35%20AM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e4ea5500-e685-41fd-8514-7bca57ad2606/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-27%20at%2010.12.35%20AM.png) We are section DSO.  It is fall 2022, so I assume that this is FA22.  It is the first exam, so I would say the first choice.  I don't remember what I picked, but I would assume option 1. This was the response from TA (to my post to TA & Instructor only)  "Please don't sign up for the exam till we release more information."  May be we can wait for TAs to confirm. ok thanks! Usually TA's sends a mail asking to book for the exam and it also mentions which one to select. Not sure if i missed that.  You beat me to it. I was also going to ask if the exam includes calculation questions, as the Coursera test policy in week 6 says we are allowed 2 pieces of scratch paper, but no calculator. Was there a confirmation from TAs regarding the course content for Exam 1. Is it 1-6 as specified in Coursera Lesson 6.10 I wonder why no TA comes up and confirm the sign-up for Exam 1. Based on my experience with other courses, sometimes the link will be changed, then we have to cancel and sign up again.

MP2.3 grade not visible on Coursera Hi everyone,  I submitted MP2.3 to live data lab and got a score of 1. However I dont see my grade updated on Coursera. I also clicked on the "Open Tool" link from coursera, and logged into live data lab from there as mentioned. Is this expected, when will we see this? ![Screen%20Shot%202022-09-23%20at%201.35.35%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/90e0a754-e68a-48c5-84ba-d7a8ba5d43ff/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-23%20at%201.35.35%20PM.png)May be can wait for sometime and try refreshing coursera. As you have the score of 1, coursera will show 100% for MP2.3 Its been 2 days since I finished the assignment, still grade doesn't show. Send email to the TA. Score should reflect immediately on coursera. Where can I see the list of TA emails? how do I see the score/points I got? All I see is the STATUS (success or fail). Click on the leaderboard from liveDataLab. You should see a score of 1 if you got a 100 percent. Do you see your grade on coursera? Oh thanks I see the score now. No, I do not see any grade on coursera. Create new post, and you can post only to instructors and TA's. Are you using the university id properly with livedatalab as login, if there is a mismatch it won't update your coursera. It doesn't show for me either Did this issue get solved for someone? sadly not for me just yet. I've been waiting for a day, the grade is also not updated for me either I followed #659, and it worked, although it didn't work yesterday.
Lesson 2.1 Hi, In Lecture 2.1, shouldn't d2 be equal to (1,1,0,0,1) instead of what is mentioned in the lecture. Since two words 'organic food' don't match with the words in the query. So the only match would be news, about, and campaign. This in turn would make f(q, d2) = 2, hence would be at the end of the list. Please let me know if I am not doing this the right way. Thanks![Screen%20Shot%202022-08-27%20at%207.12.27%20PM.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/70d37fbb-5702-4b7f-abf9-0a942cf68b56/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-27%20at%207.12.27%20PM.png)As query is " news about presidential campaign" q=(1,1,1,1,0...) As document2 has only occurrence of  words "news","about", campaign" so d2=(1,1,0,1,...) . Hence, f(q,d2) = 1x1+1x1+1x0+1x1=3. Hope this helps. Thanks for the answer. I was just wondering in the case of 'news about organic food campaign', shouldn't it be (1,1,0,0,1)? Since organic food are two different words within the document  Just as a follow up if anyone is confused, we are matching occurences of individual words in order to the original query only.  ex. query                                =      news[0] about[1] presidential[2] campaign[3] d1                                     =  ... **news about** organic food **campaign** ... original query comparison      1              1                  0                    1 *matches to the original query only in the positional text order of "news", "about", "presidential", "campaign", with each word in the document being counted and then tallied.  So, in the case of Term frequency weighting, we can see that "news about _____ campaign" fills positions 0, 1, and 3 in our 4 text sequence compared to the original query only once. Since our query is only 4 words long (positions 0-3), the values of d2 after positions 0-3 do not have an impact as the query is not searching for any words beyond "news about presidential campaign." The words in between also do not impact the sequence of order for our original query. We can imagine the query is a tally of occurrences in the document and the just tally how many times "news", "about", "presidential", and "campaign" occur. Looking next at D4, we find the word presidential (position 2) occurs twice and therefore tallies to 2.
Converging at 20 iterations in LiveDataLab but incorrect implementation My code is converging at 20 iterations and live data lab says success, but it also says, "INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION". I am not sure how to debug further.   I added many print statements to check whether my probability matrix sums to 1, etc...   Would appreciate any help on how to debug further!  ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/4de8a856-7094-4b44-9bab-5c8dff44e899/image.png)That may not be sufficient. You may still need to monitor the log likelihood in each iteration to ensure it increases monotonically. I printed them out and it is increasing monotonically, but sometimes it goes until the 50th iteration and has a likelihood of ~ 169,000. (1st iteration starts with ~ -178,000)  Interesting. You may also print out topic_word_prob (theta) and document_topic_prob (pi) to check if they make sense according to the labels in the text.txt.  My log likelihood also increased from -179013 to -159718 after 50 iterations.  Thank you! Will print out topic_word_prob (theta) and document_topic_prob (pi). I used 3 loops so maybe that might be causing the problem not sure Sure. BTW, you can round them to 3 decimals. If they are correct, they really make sense.  Have you figure out the problem? My log likelihood range is identical to yours, and the auto grader stopped a little over 20, and my results are also wrong. Haven't figured it out yet :/  Hoping a TA can give some guidance! Is your leaderboard empty? I have a lot of submissions, but none are showing up in the leaderboard as well Mine is empty as well Once I fixed an error in my M step and it passed, it also showed up in the leaderboard! Was able to fix it, my M step normalization was incorrect. thanks!
Downloading Lecture Slides with coursera-dl on MAC Hi, I realized that it's quite time consuming to manually go through each week's lecture video to have all the slides downloaded so I looked into how I can do that in bulk. It may be helpful for you if you are in similar situations, here's how I did it:  In the terminal, type:  1. pip install coursera-dl 2. coursera-dl -u <user> -p <pass> -ca <cauth_token> --path <download_path> -f "pdf" cs-410  and you should see it start downloading the pdf lecture slides.  <user> is just your Coursera log in email, similarly for <pass>, you don't need quotation marks over them.  <download_path> should be a path to the directory where you'd like your lecture slides stored.  Here is how to find the cauth_token ([reference](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/409668/how-to-install-and-run-coursera-dl-on-m1-mac-without-errors)) : 1 First login to coursera.org in your web browser, for example, in chrome 2 Go to web browser settings 3 Advanced 4 Privacy and Security 5 Site Settings 6 Cookies and Site Data 7 See all cookies and site data 8 Find coursera.org, click into it and check for CAUTH 9 Copy this value. It might be kinda big  To find your course name (if you are interested in other courses), just use the name after /learn/ in the url for your course. E.g. https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-410/home/ would give you the course name: cs-410  More documentations on coursera-dl: https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl#running-the-script
Can I use calculator in Exam 1 Can I use calculator in Exam 1?No. You are allowed only two sheets of paper or a whiteboard. So if there are questions related to gamma-code(compress problem), we need to calculate log manually? For gamma encoding, the key calculation is floor(log base 2 of X). The floor function makes this much more simple. Basically, you only need to find a power of 2 that is closest to X, but not greater than X.   Suppose X=10. To find floor(log2(10)): 1. The largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 10 is 8. 2. 8 = 2^3, so floor(log2(10) = 3.  In fact, floor(log2(X)) = 3 for any integer X from 8 to 15. Does this help? Thanks
Exam 1 could not be started Dear Professor and TAs, I scheduled Exam1 for 9:40 am CT today (Mon 10/10) but after 70 minutes, Proctor U was not able to start the exam. Here is a Coursera screen shot as evidence: ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2a7a8d1e-3a24-4db4-919f-2014b58c3ca3/5631ca1a-54e9-4f49-be86-e0c157e36051/image.png) ProctorU claimed that "the institution [UIUC] provided the wrong password" and that they "left email and voice mail for the instructor and institution but received no response". ProctorU declined to identify exact contact information, so I cannot confirm who exactly was contacted. ProctorU maintained that they can do nothing until they receive a response.  Please know that Coursera is configured to allow only one attempt by ProctorU to enter the password (see screen shot below). ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/8b301ad9-d083-4cc2-9c4a-7fb9c2c1456b/image.png) However, Proctor U claims they are not limited in how many attempts they have to get the password right. During the 70-minute session, I watched ProctorU go back numerous times to the above page in Coursera, but they were unable to enter another password. At the moment, I cannot even reschedule the exam because ProctorU wants to restart the previous failed session (see screen shot). ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a082d795-1f3a-453f-91ce-a9482a12ce4e/image.png) Please advise what to do. I was ready to take the exam at this time, so this situation is very disconcerting. David BurrusWe're investigating this right now. Hang tight.  Hey David,  1) just checked the password on Coursera and ProctorU, they do match. I think the proctor just didn't copy it over correctly. 2) the contact for exam issues is JC (jcmorgan@illinois.edu) , JC hasn't received any communication from PorctorU about this issue yet (I just checked with him).  3) what we can do is increase the number of attempts for the Exam Password (you're right, its now only 1 attempt allowed)   David, I just changed the number of attempts for the Password to "Unlimited attempts", this should allow the proctors to attempt to enter the password multiple times until they get it right. Assma, I suspect that you are correct: the proctor did not copy it correctly. He told me that I did not need to look away, as stated in the instructions. When he pasted in the password, I saw that the number of dots was at least 50 or 60 characters -- perhaps not coincidentally, similar in the length to the URL he had pasted just previously into the address bar.  Thank you very much for increasing the number of password attempts. What should be my next step -- can I try to "reconnect" to the exam at any time? I do not know the guidelines for such a situation. David yes David, let's try to "reconnect" first.  If JC receives anything from them I'll update you here.  worst case scenario we get you to re-register for the exam for another slot (sorry about that).  But let's try to reconnect first, since you didn't get your money's worth :)  Assma,  I am online right now with ProctorU. The latest proctor has tried three times to connect, but so far we have not passed the password test. I believe she tried more than one password, but of course I have no information about those passwords. Have other CS410 students been able to start the exam?  David ok this is starting to get weird. Let me recheck the passwords Assma, The proctor advises that copy-and-paste does not work in this case. She has been typing it manually. David checked it again, they match David... I haven't heard of any other student who's running into this too (although you might be the very first student to attempt the Exam)  is there a way I can join the zoom?  are you in? I'm watching you live, I see the password went through. Good luck David this proctor is ridiculous, you should be able to just start your Exam, as long as you see the "start" button, means everything is passed Assma, sorry for not responding until now but I really wanted to start (and finish) get the exam, and my confidence in ProctorU was not high. I'm glad you were able to witness some of my experience.  FYI -- and I share this only in case other students have problems -- when I tried to reconnect, two different proctors in a row (Billy S and Ryalin) disconnected almost immediately, without any explanation. I only can guess that they thought I was late for my 9:40 scheduled time. There definitely were no Internet access issues, at least on my side. So, on my third "reconnect" attempt, I immediately typed in the ProctorU chat box "PLEASE DO NOT HANG UP, THIS IS A SESSION RECONNECT". Maybe the third proctor (Zyrellen C) would have continued the session anyway, but I did not want to take any chances. Zyrellen was very nice, actually, but like this morning's proctor (Bharat M) needed a ProctorU "advocate" (higher level of customer service rep, I think) to help enter the password. It became a little absurd when the advocate, Douglas G, entered the password correctly (100% from Coursera) then proceeded to enter it again, twice. It's possible he was having Zyrellen practice the password: there was no audio at this time. This morning, about an hour into the call, I did ask ProctorU if any of the other 250-ish students in this class had similar password issues, but they did not answer. So maybe you're right: I was their first student to attempt this exam.  In any case, all done! Woo-hoo! 
F1-score why is it more popular Why is F-1 score more popular than F-2, F-3 score etc? Any reason for it/ use cases?As per my understanding, the F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall where it gives equal weightage to precision and recall. The more generic F-beta score applies additional weights, valuing one of precision or recall more than the other. Usecases where recall is twice as important as precision the F2 score will be more appropriate. Example of higher recall usecase (as given in practice quiz) - automatic system to filter tweets of the possible communication between terrorists.

MP2.4 can’t submit ![image2022-09-27%2011%3A24%3A42.jpg](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/e7728a87-9711-420b-b51e-558716a0f78b/image2022-09-27%2011%3A24%3A42.jpg) I can’t  submit successfully from the first time. I didn’t change the code, and just pushed. But the status is failure.can you post the error. you can go into the red highlighted link and take a screenshot of the console output. I think that is because your github personal access token is expired.  Please follow the week 1 instructions to regenerate a personal access token in github and then relink the github account in livedatalab.  The screenshot of the error code will be helpful Thanks !That’s the answer I just experienced the same issue, the root cause is because the github personal access token has expired. The steps I follow to solve the issue:  1. Follow the livelab set up instruction to create a new token from github Settings 2. Click "Delete Linked Accounts" from the Live data lab page 3. Delete expired tokens in Github 4. Click "Link new account" in the Live data lab page, input your new token in the "API Key" 4. Try a dummy push from your repo, it will ask for user name and password, for password, paste the token instead
